We have described our reasons for this action below and,\nwhere possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCDRH/DEVICE\n\n1. As part of the device description, we were unable to locate the following alarms\nconsistent with the FDA Guidance, Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle within your\nsubmission for the Furoscix Infusor:\n¢ Occlusion detection alarm\ne Low or empty reservoir alarm\ne Undocking alarm\ne Key pressed alarm\ne Tone test failure alarm\n\nThe Agency believes these alarms are critical to the safe operation of the device. Make\nappropriate changes to the device, provide a justification for why these alarms are not\nnecessary, or provide alternative mitigations.\n\n2. Inthe study, CP-00001 Product Design Clinical Validation, you defined the volume\naccuracy endpoint as “Delivery 80mg +10% = minimal 9mL dispensed from device.”\nThis is inconsistent with the device specifications which state dose accuracy as volume to\nbe delivered: © Therefore, according to the device\nspecifications the delivery volume should be between! mL. It is unclear how dose\n\nReference ID: 4275803\n\nNDA 209988\n\nPage 2\n\nReference ID: 4275803\n\naccuracy was measured in this pivotal study. Since dose accuracy is a critical endpoint\nthis discrepancy needs to be resolved. Please describe how you measured dose accuracy\nin the study and how the study validates the design specifications for the device.\n\n. According to the results from the CP-00001, Product Design Clinical Validation study\n\nyou did not meet the predefined endpoints. Please address how the improvements since\nthe study was completed result in a device that can meet the pre-defined endpoints for\nthis particular study and provide evidence to validate that these changes are likely to\naddress the errors or provide a new clinical validation study. (Please see the Clinical\ncomments for additional information regarding study CP-00001).\n\nYou provided several documents outlining the Risk Management process for the Furoscix\nInfusor in Sequence 0001/3.2R. The risk assessment criteria and risk acceptability as\noutlined in RA-0002, scPharmaceuticals Risk Management Plan, Appendix I, defines the\nseverity, occurrence and detection ratings in accordance with ISO 14971. Additionally,\nyou have defined the risk threshold for the intended use of the Furoscix Infusor on p.7-8\n\nas: (b) (4)\n\nThe resulting risk and hazard analyses do not follow the definitions as defined in RA-\n0002.pdf. From a high-level perspective, the Agency disagrees with the severity ratings\nassigned in the Use Error Analysis (DD-0001.pdf), scPharmaceuticals Risk Management\nReport (RA-0023.pdf), seCFAS Risk Analysis Report (RA-0010.pdf) and\nscPharmaceuticals Hazard Analysis (RA-0007.pdf) to the hazards of underdosing,\ninfection and over-diuresis for the following reasons:\n\na.

We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nthese issues.\n\nCLINICAL AND STATISTICAL\n\nYour submitted data do not support a favorable benefit-risk assessment of vadadustat\nfor the proposed indication of treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD) in adults not on dialysis and on dialysis. Our determination that the\nbenefits of vadadustat do not outweigh the risks applies to both the non-dialysis-\ndependent (NDD) and dialysis-dependent (DD) populations of patients with anemia\nassociated with CKD.\n\nWith regard to the benefits of vadadustat, you have met the efficacy endpoint of\nhemoglobin (Hb) response by demonstrating that the change from baseline in Hb with\nvadadustat is non-inferior to that of darbepoetin alfa, an erythropoietin stimulating agent\n(ESA), in both the NDD and DD populations of patients with anemia associated with\nCKD. However, there was higher use of rescue therapy for worsening anemia with\nvadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa, particularly for ESA rescue in the NDD-CKD\npopulation and for ESA and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion rescue in the DD-CKD\npopulation. Some of these differences in rescue therapy are striking. For example, in\nDD-CKD Trial 0016, ESA rescue for worsening anemia was reported in 22% of\nvadadustat-treated patients compared to 5% of darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. The\ncorresponding rates in DD-CKD Trial 0017 were 35% and 14%. In addition, in the DD-\nCKD trials there was a higher incidence of RBC transfusion rescue therapy for\nworsening anemia with vadadustat, which could potentially impact alloreactivity, a risk\nfactor for renal allograft rejection in patients who undergo kidney transplantation.\n\nReference ID: 4960457\n\nNDA 215192\nPage 2\n\nAs an oral therapy, vadadustat may offer convenience compared to the intravenous\nroute of ESAs, especially in the NDD-CKD population and the minority of dialysis\npatients who receive peritoneal dialysis. However, the convenience of an oral drug in\nthe DD-CKD population is less clear for most DD-CKD patients in the United States\n(U.S.), who receive hemodialysis and are administered ESA at the time of hemodialysis.\n\nThe trials established no other benefits of vadadustat in the NDD-CKD or DD-CKD\npopulations.\n\nWe have identified the following major safety concerns with vadadustat that outweigh\nthese benefits:\n\n1.\n\nIn the NDD-CKD population primary analysis, you did not establish non-inferiority\nfor vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa on the primary safety endpoint of\nadjudicated major adverse cardiac events (MACE) — a composite of all-cause\nmortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke — with a hazard\nratio (HR) of 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.36). The upper bound of this\n95% confidence interval excluded the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1.25.\nFurthermore, the lower bound excluded the value of no effect. The risk of MACE\nwith vadadustat was seen in comparison to darbepoetin alfa, an ESA with an\nestablished increased risk of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and all-cause\nmortality. In addition, each component of the adjudicated MACE endpoint had a\nnumerically unfavorable HR for vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa.\n\nYour conclusion that vadadustat is safe in the U.S. population is not supported by\nthe data.

Your submitted data raise concerns for a clinically significant risk for drug-\n\ninduced liver injury (DILI) with the use of vadadustat in patients with CKD. This\nconclusion is based on one Hy’s Law case, at least seven cases of probable\ndrug-induced liver injury (DILI) with significant elevation in alanine\naminotransferase (ALT) without jaundice, and an imbalance in ALT elevations\nwith vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa (e.g., ALT >3x ULN in 0.47% of\npatients treated with vadadustat compared to 0.35% of patients treated with\ndarbepoetin alfa; ALT >5x ULN in 0.31% of patients treated with vadadustat vs.\n0.25% of patients treated with darbepoetin alfa). The elevation in alkaline\nphosphatase in the Hy’s Law case does not preclude a conclusion of\nhepatocellular DILI. Using the new R-value (nR value) criterion, this subject had\nhepatocellular DILI with at least 10% mortality risk, fulfilling Hy’s Law.\n\nFurthermore, we have concerns that the risks seen in the clinical trials where patients\nwere closely monitored (e.g., with liver tests), may underestimate the risks with real-\nworld use of vadadustat, if approved. Given that ESAs are typically administered by\nhealth care providers, hemoglobin and patient monitoring is fairly well assured. With the\nconvenience of an orally administered drug such as vadadustat, there is the potential for\ninadequate patient monitoring (e.g., hemoglobin, liver tests) that could lead to worse\noutcomes in some settings as well as the potential to prescribe vadadustat to patients\nwith anemia and decreased creatinine clearance who presently do not receive ESAs.\nSome of these patients, particularly the elderly, would be at greater risk of MACE. We\ncould not identify a risk mitigation strategy that can adequately mitigate the risks of\nvadadustat with the proposed dosing regimen to ensure that the benefits of vadadustat\noutweigh its risks.\n\nPotential Path Forward:\n\n1.\n\nConduct new clinical trial(s) that establish a favorable benefit/risk assessment of\nvadadustat in a specific patient population or with a different dosing regimen. In\nyour new clinical trial(s) also assess the following:\n\ne The occurrence of ESA and RBC transfusion rescue therapies, as key\nsecondary efficacy endpoints.\n\ne Rhabdomyolysis as an adverse event of interest, with appropriate clinical and\nlaboratory assessments.

You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by\nspecific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined\nthat we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nthese issues.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\nFacility Inspections\n\n1. Following an evaluation of the last inspection performed at Tanvex BioPharma,\nInc. (FEI: 3013021112) manufacturing facility at 10394 Pacific Center Court, San\nDiego, CA 92121 for this application, our field investigator observed\nobjectionable conditions at the facility and conveyed that information to the\nrepresentative of the facility at the close of the inspection. Satisfactory resolution\nof the remaining objectionable conditions, and verification by the FDA, is required\nbefore this application may be approved.\n\nWe will continue to monitor the public health situation as well as travel\nrestrictions. We are actively working to define an approach for scheduling\noutstanding inspections, once safe travel may resume and based on public\nhealth need and other factors.\n\nReference ID: 4798988\n\nBLA 761126\nPage 2\n\nFor more information, please see the FDA guidances related to COVID 19.\nThese guidances can be found at htips://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-\nand-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-related-quidance-\ndocuments-industry-fda-staff-and-other-stakeholders.\n\n2.

Your March 19, 2021\nIR response did not adequately address the following issues, impacting the\nreliability of the data provided to demonstrate that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-\nlicensed Neupogen:\n\n(b) (4)\n\nIn addition, in Complete Response (CR) comment 2b in the CR letter dated\nSeptember 24, 2019, issues were raised regarding data omission for the competitive\nbinding ELISA assay. In the response to the March 15, 2021 IR, you provided a list\nof all the runs and samples that were excluded from the analysis. However,\ninadequate justification was provided for the exclusion of data with binding ratios\n\n®® and replicates that do not appear to be identical. Given the number of runs\nwith binding ratios \" there is a concern that the method was not sufficiently\nqualified for its intended use.\n\nOverall, these issues raise concerns regarding the quality of the data from G-CSF\nreceptor binding analysis by SPR and competitive binding analysis by ELISA\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 4798988\n\nBLA 761126\nPage 3\n\nsubmitted to support the comparative analytical assessment be\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nthese issues.\n\nCLINICAL\n\n1. You have not provided data to demonstrate the tolerability of Legubeti, the lysine\nsalt of acetylcysteine, for the full range of loading and maintenance doses for\npatients with all body weights proposed in labeling.\n\nBoth lysine and acetylcysteine have an unpleasant taste, and acetylcysteine has\nan unpleasant odor that may affect the tolerability of oral ingestion. The data to\naddress the effect of the lysine on the palatability of Legubeti is inadequate. The\ncompleted relative bioavailability study with Legubeti and the acetylcysteine oral\nsolution (a reference standard as a substitute for the relied-upon listed drug)\nconducted with 1 gm of acetylcysteine is not adequate to address palatability\nbecause most patients will receive higher doses (up to 15 gm) based on the\nproposed weight-based dosage. Because timely administration of acetylcysteine\nis essential to mitigate toxicity from acetaminophen overdose, uncertainty\nremains as to whether ingestion of the full Legubeti dose can be administered,\neither due to inadequate palatability or inadequate tolerability. Consequently,\nthese uncertainties place patients at increased risk of acetaminophen-induced\ntoxicity.\n\nTo resolve this deficiency conduct palatability and tolerability studies at clinically\nrelevant dose(s). The proposed Clinical investigation to address this deficiency\n\nReference ID: 5169156\n\nNDA 215040\nPage 2\n\nshould include a patient reported outcomes (PRO) instrument that is fit-for-\npurpose. Before embarking on tolerability and palatability studies we recommend\nreaching agreement with the Division of Clinical Outcomes Assessment (DCOA)\nregarding your PRO to ensure it is valid.\n\nYou have not provided adequate information to support the safety of L-lysine\nadministration to pediatric patients weighing down to 1 kg. This information is\nneeded to inform the benefit-risk assessment of this product in the pediatric\npopulation. The maximum daily amount of L-lysine expected to be administered\nwith Legubeti at the proposed dosage ranges from 502.6 mg/kg/day including the\nloading dose on the first day to 313 mg/kg/day after completion of the\nmaintenance doses on the last day of treatment. The amount of L-lysine\nexpected to be delivered with the proposed dosage of Legubeti exceeds the\nestimated daily intake of L-lysine in enterally fed term neonates.\n\nTo resolve this deficiency provide additional information (e.g., published literature\nor a study) to justify the safety of the L-lysine exposure in pediatric patients down\nto 1 kg, for the proposed indication.\n\nREGULATORY\n\n3. The relied-upon listed drug for this 505(b)(2) application is Mucomyst. You cited\n\nthe Cetylev prescribing information in order to comply with the Physician Labeling\nRule (PLR) and the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR). It is\nacceptable to refer to the Cetylev label for the purpose of PLR and PLLR\nformatting. However, if you are relying on FDA's finding of safety and/or\neffectiveness for Cetylev (or another listed drug) concerning Lactation,\nPregnancy, and Females and Males of Reproductive Potential information, you\nmust comply with the legal/regulatory requirements for such reliance (e.g.,\nestablishing a scientific bridge, patent certification).

The\n\ndeficiencies are summarized as follows:\n\nCLINICAL\n\nWe acknowledge that you have submitted three well-controlled studies (Studies 005, 006, and 013)\nthat show effectiveness for the adjunctive use of istradefylline 20mg, 40mg, and 60mg/day (without\nclear evidence of dose response) in decreasing the percent of time awake spent in the OFF state in\npatients with advanced Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Several other well-controlled studies of adequate\nsize, however, do not show such an effect and in one of those studies, Study EU-007, an active control,\nentacapone, gave an almost significant result (p=0.06) while istradefylline showed essentially no\neffect. Entacapone, moreover, had a favorable effect on the PGI, a patient-rated global measure in that\nstudy, while istradefylline did not.

For the 4-, 13-, and 26-week studies in rat and the 2-year mouse study, your re-examination of\nbrain included cutting additional sections and employing a variety of stains (e.g., PAS, von Kossa,\nalizarin red). Using these techniques, you detected a dose-related incidence of foci of mineralization in\nbrains in the 13- and 26-week rat studies, but not in the 2-year mouse study. It is not clear that similar\ntechniques were used to re-examine brains from the subchronic and chronic toxicity studies in dog.\n\nYou provided no overall summary of the methodology used and the results of the original and re-\nexamination of brain samples, or expert opinions regarding the nature of the mineralization and\npossible relationship or lack of relationship to drug.

We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCLINICAL\n\nAlthough we have concluded that cladribine is effective as a treatment for patients with\nrelapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), safety concerns associated with its use\npreclude its approval at this time.\n\nSubstantial evidence of cladribine’s effectiveness was provided by the CLARITY study.\nThis study was an adequate and well-controlled clinical study of oral cladribine in patients\nwith RRMS that was rigorously designed and executed. The effect of cladribine was\ndemonstrated by effects on relapse rate, disability progression, and various imaging markers\nof disease activity. These findings were consistently demonstrated with multiple analyses\nand are robust. We believe that the data, taken as a whole, meet the standard for substantial\nevidence of effectiveness, as provided by one adequate and well controlled clinical trial and\nconfirmatory evidence.\n\nReference ID: 2910781\n\nReference ID: 4413345\n\nNDA 022561\nPage 2\n\nThese benefits of cladribine, however, are outweighed by its risks. The presence of a\ndisproportionate number of malignancies in cladribine-treated subjects represents an\nunacceptable risk.\n\nCladribine clearly appears to be associated with an increased risk of malignancy. In the\nCLARITY trial, there were four cases of malignancy in cladribine-treated subjects and none\nin placebo-treated subjects. When considering the entire safety database, in completed\nstudies of cladribine and ongoing controlled studies of cladribine, there were 33 cases of\nmalignancy in cladribine-treated subjects and two in placebo-treated subjects. These\nmalignancies are found in a wide variety of anatomic sites. Analysis of a subset of these\npatients revealed 8.2 cases of malignancy per 1000 cladribine-treated subjects (13 cases in\n1579 subjects) in all oral cladribine trials worldwide and no cases in placebo. In trials of oral\ncladribine in the U.S. the incidence was even higher with 18.3 cases of malignancy per 1000\nsubjects in cladribine treated subjects (3 cases in 164 subjects) and no cases in placebo.\nOngoing reporting of malignancy cases submitted throughout the review period appears to be\nconsistent with these rates. We analyzed whether increasing cumulative cladribine dose or\nincreasing duration of clinical monitoring played a role in the development of malignancy\nbut found no evidence of such relationship. We also investigated the latency from time of\nfirst cladribine dose to time of malignancy diagnosis and found no evidence that any cases\noccurred an implausibly short time following exposure to cladribine.\n\nThis increased risk of malignancy seen in cladribine-treated subjects as compared \n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

You must provide an improved understanding of this risk,\neither through additional analyses or by conducting additional studies, before we could\nconsider approving this application.\n\nWe note that while you have agreed that the association between malignancies and cladribine\nrepresents a potential significant safety concern, you have provided several arguments that\nseek to address this concern. We have reviewed your arguments and do not agree with your\nconclusions.\n\nYou have compared the rate of malignancy in cladribine-treated subjects to an expected\ngeneral population rate, calculated using epidemiologic data. Comparisons to epidemiologic\ndata are problematic, because rates of malignancy based on epidemiologic data vary greatly\naccording to many factors, including location, age, and gender. We are concerned that\ncomparing malignancy rates in cladribine-treated subjects to rates based on epidemiologic\ndata, as opposed to randomized controls, may not adequately account for important\ndifferences between groups. We request additional information on the methods used in\ncalculating the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) described on pages 289-290 of the\nIntegrated Summary of Safety.\n\nYou have discussed that many malignancy cases in cladribine-treated subjects were cases of\ncancer that rarely metastasize and are almost always curable by surgical resection (e.g., basal\ncell carcinoma). We remain concerned, because an increased risk of malignancy in\ncladribine-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects persists after excluding these\ncases.\n\nReference ID: 2910781\n\nReference ID: 4413345\n\nNDA 022561\nPage 3\n\nYou have discussed that pre-existing risk factors have been documented in cladribine-treated\nsubjects with reported cases of malignancy. We remain concerned, as pre-existing risk\nfactors are likely to exist in some placebo-treated subjects, as well. We request clarification\non whether risk factors for malignancy were documented in all study subjects, and whether\nan imbalance in pre-existing risk factors has been documented in cladribine-treated subjects\nas compared to placebo-treated subjects.\n\nYou have discussed that the analyses of the long-term data are potentially biased due to\nconfounding by time since randomization. Although we agree that there is considerably\nmore long-term experience under treatment, compared to placebo, conditions, we note that\nthere is still a worrisome signal for malignancy in CLARITY. Although the maximum\nduration of observation in CLARITY is 2 years, we believe that this is a sufficient duration\nof exposure to cladribine to consider any malignancies occurring then to be biologically\nplausible. Further, the signal seen in the long-term extension contributes to our concern,\ngiven our lack of a detailed understanding of what rate of malignancies should be expected\nover that duration of time.\n\nYou have discussed conducting a long-term prospective follow-up safety registry\n(PREMIERE) to assess the risk of malignancies, as well as serious infections, lymphopenia,\nand other adverse events of special interest in subjects with MS who have participated in\nclinical trials of oral cladribine. We remain concerned, as it is unclear how this registry will\nserve to mitigate the risk of malignancy. We request additional information on the\ninformation to be collected and the planned methods for analysis, including details on how\nthe expected rates of adverse events will be determined.\n\nWe have the following additional comments that will need to be addressed, assuming you\ncan successfully respond to the previous concerns related to malignancies:\n\n1. Cladribine causes a prompt and sustained decrease in absolute lymphocyte count occurring\nshortly after exposure to cladribine. In the CLARITY study, a majority of subjects continued\nto have significant lymphopenia at the time of last assessment.

Kook, Ph.D.\n\nU.S. Agent for Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited\nSalamandra, LLC\n\nOne Bethesda Center\n\n4800 Hampden Lane, Suite 900\n\nBethesda, Maryland 20814-2998\n\nDear Dr. Kook:\n\nPlease refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated March 29, 2015, received March 30,\n2015, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n(FDCA), for Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Injection, 10 mg/mL.\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated June 4, 11, and 26; July 2, 13, and 28;\nAugust 18 and 25; and September 22 and 29, 2015.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we\ncannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nFACILITY INSPECTIONS\n\n1. During a recent inspection of the Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd manufacturing\nfacility for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the\nrepresentative of the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required\nbefore this application may be approved.\n\nMANUFACTURING PROCESS\n\n2.\n\nReference ID: 3851154\n\nNDA 208313\nPage 2\n\no®\n\nHUMAN FACTOR STUDY\n\nWe recommend the following comments be implemented prior to commencing the gemcitabine\nhydrochloride in sodium chloride injection summative human factors study.\n\n3. Review the protocol for inconsistencies. For example, error debrief is listed in the test\nscript, but not in the testing procedure description.\n\n4. Clarify who the intended end user is for the proposed IFU. If the IFU is meant for nurses\nand pharmacists, then it is unclear why body surface area (BSA) and Target Dose are\nprovided in the IFU. Revise the IFU to remove this information, or provide rationale for\nincluding the BSA and Target Dose in the IFU.\n\n5. It appears the proposed product is intended for patients with BSAs ranging from 1.2 mr to\n2.6 m?; however, the IFU contains the statement\n\nClarify whether the proposed product is intended for use with patients with BSAs ranging\nfrom 1.2 m? to 2.6 m/, or if it is only intended for use with the specific BSAs listed in the\nIFU table (e.g. 1.2 m’, 1.3 m?, 1.4 m2, etc.).\n\na. If it’s intended for the range of BSAs from 1.2 m? to 2.6 m’, then provide\nprescribing instructions on dose banding and clarification on how dose banding\nshould be performed for BSA values with two decimal places. For example, if a\npatient has a BSA of 1.75 m? and requires a dose of 1,000 mg/m? (calculated dose\nis 1,750 mg), then is the correct dose after dose banding 1700 mg, or 1800 mg?\n\ndb. If it’s intended for the specific BSAs listed in the IFU table, then evaluate the\neffectiveness of the statement “For the treatment...” under step 1 of IFU in the\nhuman factors study to provide assurance that nurses and pharmacists will not use\nthe proposed product for a patient with BSA of 1.75 m2.\n\n6. To better simulate a real life scenario in the identification and differentiation of tasks, the\nIFU may be provided to the human factor study participants, but do not instruct the\nparticipant to review the IFU prior to receiving their prescription card in the human factor\nstudy. In the usual clinical setting, the end user (pharmacist or nurse) would receive the\nprescription first. If the end user needs help with interpretation or calculation of dose, he\nor she would have the option to refer to the PI and/or IFU that are packaged with the\ndrug.\n\n7. Nurses will be required to administer two bags in some cases. We recommend inclusion\n\nof tasks that would assess how effective the product labeling and the IFU are in\naddressing the risk of omission of the second bag to be infused by the nurse.\n\nReference ID: 3851154\n\nNDA 208313\nPage 3\n\nPRESCRIBING INFORMATION\n\n\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendments by specific\nreference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined\nthat we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nthese issues.\n\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\n(1) The results of the pharmacokinetic (PK) bridging study PRV-031-004' in\nhealthy volunteers failed to show PK comparability between the PRV-031\nproduct used in TN-102 and the planned commercial product. Study\nPRV-031-004 revealed considerable differences in the total area under the\ntime-concentration curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCo-int) between the two\nproducts, with the planned commercial product providing an approximately {/f4j%\nlower AUC.int, despite a comparable Cmax after a single intravenous infusion.\nAs PK remains the primary endpoint for demonstration of comparability\nbetween the two products, you will need to establish PK comparability\nappropriately between the intended commercial product and the clinical trial\n\n1 A Phase 1, Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel Group, Single-Dose Study in Healthy Subjects to\nEvaluate the Bio comparability of Teplizumab (PRV-031) Manufactured at Two Sites\n2 Anti-CD3 mAb (Teplizumab) for Prevention of Diabetes in Relatives At-Risk for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus\n\nReference ID: 4821208\n\nBLA 761183\nPage 2\n\nproduct, or provide other data that adequately justify why PK comparability is\nnot necessary.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\n(2) Results of your ongoing real-time stability studies demonstrate unacceptable\ncharge variation measured in PRV-031 drug substance manufactured at AGC\nBiologics and the resulting drug product under recommended storage\nconditions. For instance,\n\neither drug substance or drug product, not only because of the unacceptable\ndegree of change, but also because stability behavior is not consistent between\ndrug product lots manufactured using AGC material. This degree of change\nalso prevents a determination as to whether there is a problem with product\nstability, the method, or both. Finally, the possibility that this variation arises\nfrom method variability also introduces uncertainty into the reliability of all\nresults generated with this method, including the analytical comparability\nassessment, highlighted by the difference in stability behavior between AGC\nlots and lots manufactured by Eli Lilly. To address these deficiencies:\n\na. Provide data and information regarding the source of the variability of the\nPRV-031 drug product and drug substance charge profile on stability as\nmeasured by the CEX-HPLC assay.\n\nb. Address and remediate the source of the charge variation of PRV-031\nmanufactured at AGC.\n\nc. Address the differences in PRV-031 stability behavior between clinical\nmaterial manufactured at Eli Lilly and proposed commercial material\nmanufactured at AGC Biologics.\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 4821208\n\nBLA 761183\n\nPage 3\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nd.

We have described our reasons for this action below and,\nwhere possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCLINICAL/STATISTICAL\n\n1. In the approval of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists for the palliative treatment of\nadvanced prostate cancer, testosterone levels serve as a surrogate marker of efficacy. When\nall available testosterone levels are used in the analysis, nn)\nLutrate Depot 22.5 mg failed to achieve and maintain castrate testosterone levels in an\nacceptable percentage of patients.\n\ntestosterone levels between Daya! 28-168 in 83.9% of patients. Further, the results of these\nstudies are difficult to interpret since there may have been marked variations in dose due to\nthe extent of overfill in each Lutrate vial.\n\nTo address this deficiency, you should optimize your formulations ere el\n(uutate Depot 22.5 mg and conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety\nand efficacy of your products.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\n2. The batch formula cannot accurately reflect drug product composition because batches were\n\nmanufactured with different amounts of excipients. Provide a batch formula that reflects the\nproposed composition of the drug product registration batches.\n\nReference ID: 3769331\n\nNDA 205054\nPage 2\n\n4.

Provide justifications\nbut NOT calculations to estimate the amount of SS\n\n5. The chemical physical properties of the drug substance have to be generated from the actual\ndrug substance batches produced from manufacture. Provide chemical and physical\nproperties of the drug substance from your manufactured batches.\n\n6. The stability of the three primary batches of drug substance and drug product is not\nacceptable because no stability data for the drug substance were provided in the NDA. We\nconsider the provided drug product stability data to only be supportive since they were\nobtained from annual reports. In addition, these data were collected from drug product\nbatches obtained from marketed product available in foreign countries and packaged in a\ndifferent packaging configuration. Based on the above information, expiry dating for the\ndrug substance and drug product cannot be established. Provide a stability study and related\ntest data of the three primary batches of the drug substance and drug product.\n\nReference ID: 3769331\n\nNDA 205054\nPage 3\n\nREGULATORY:\n\n9.

We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nWe also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated May 15 and 29;\n\nJune 5 and 11, 2020, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate\napplicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to\nthe deficiencies cited in this letter.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\n(1) The proposed drug product specification does not include test to assure the drug\nproduct can be safety and accurately expelled onto the lesion area and avoid the\nadjacent healthy skin. The specification for the final assembled drug product\nshould be revised to include the following:\n\na. A test for the crushing force of the glass ampule.\n\nb. A leakage test after ampule crushing to assure there is no drug leakage at\nrelease and during shelf-life.\n\nc. A droplet test to demonstrate that the users are capable of dispensing\nvarious amount of drug product as needed to the affected skin area while\navoiding the adjacent healthy skin.\n\n(2) The extraction solutions, ®® used in the\nextractable/leachable study are considered inadequate because:\n\nReference ID: 4639627\n\nNDA 212905\n\nPage 2\n\nb.

We note one use error and three difficulties with the critical task. The\nuse error occurred when the user removed the cap and paperboard sleeve, tipped\nthe applicator upside down and broke the ampule with two hands. Additionally,\nthree other users had difficulty breaking the ampule, which required two hands to\nbreak. Of these three use difficulties, one user also tilted the applicator\nhorizontally. Based on your use-related risk analysis (URRA), this task is\nconsidered critical because premature cap removal and incorrect applicator\nor\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

Despite the use error and\ndifficulties with critical task, you did not propose any additional mitigation\nstrategies to address the use issues (e.g., reducing the force required to break the\nampule).\n\nWe note your heuristic analysis submitted on April 10, 2020 indicates that the\naverage palmar pinch force (grip used to break an ampule) for adult females is 16\nlbs. and that the average force to break the ampule with paperboard sleeve on is\n19 lbs. From this information you concluded that the force to break the ampule\n\nReference ID: 4639627\n\nNDA 212905\nPage 4\n\ncould increase the potential for use errors - “there is a potential that users will\nstruggle to break the glass ampule due to the amount of force required. There is\nrisk that some users may remove the paperboard sleeve in order to try and break\nthe glass ampule. There is also potential for users to utilize other means to break\nthe ampule if they are unable to generate enough force with their hands.”\n\nWe also reviewed your April 10, 2020 threshold/comparative analyses with Eskata\nand Levulan Kerastick; products with some similarities to the proposed product in\nthis review. We determined that the Levulan Kerastick has a different user\ninterface than your proposed product because the Levulan Kerastick includes the\nKerastick Krusher device as a means of breaking the ampule prior to\nadministration. This difference may impact performance of the critical task of\nbreaking the ampule. Furthermore, with respect to the comparative analyses to\nthe Eskata product, we note postmarketing medication error cases that report\naccidental exposure to patient and health care professionals when using the\nproduct. Given some of the similar design attributes with your proposed product,\nwe are concerned that accidental exposure can occur with cantharidin topical\nsolution, which may present a different risk. As such, we have determined that a\nleveraging approach for your proposed product is not appropriate and the residual\nrisk with your product is unacceptable.\n\nn summary, we remain concerned that your proposed cantharidin combination\nproduct is not safe for use by HCPs. We are concerned that the risk of accidental\nexposure will outweigh the benefit of the treatment with this combination product.\nnherent design issues exist with this product that may contribute to serious harm\nif accidental exposure occurs during use. Thus, additional mitigation strategies are\nneeded and could include the need for device design changes to optimize\napplicator use along with other revisions to the product user interface taking into\nconsideration our previously identified concerns and the data collected from your\nHF validation study. After you implement additional risk mitigation\nstrategies/modifications, we recommend you conduct an additional HF validation\nstudy to ensure that these modifications address the observed use errors and use\ndifficulties and do not introduce any new risks.\n\nWe recommend you submit your revised HF validation study protocol for feedback\nfrom the Agency before commencing the study. Please note we will need 60 days\nto review and provide comments on the HF validation study protocol.

You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific\nreference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we\ncannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCLINICAL / STATISTICAL\n\nYour resubmitted application contained the report of the prospectively designed “Study #17” which\naimed to evaluate Fluorodopa F 18 for: 1) sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility in the differential\ndiagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes, 2) inter-reader reliability, 3) quantitative correlation with\nParkinson’s disease diagnosis, and 4) safety by monitoring for adverse events. This study does not\nprovide sufficient confirmatory evidence of effectiveness and the Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan’s\nperformance is not adequately characterized.\n\nIn Study #17, 45 movement disorder patients were imaged with Fluorodopa F 18. Of these patients,\n\n32 had images interpreted as positive for visualization of a loss of dopaminergic neurons in striatum and\n13 were interpreted as negative.\n\nReference ID: 3986392\n\nNDA 200655\nPage 2\n\nOut of these 13 patients, only 5 patients had undergone a clinical follow up which was to serve as a\nstandard of reference and only 1 of these patients had a clinical follow up at a pre-defined time interval\nfollowing the Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan (>1 year). Some patients had an interval as short as one or two\nweeks. Therefore, out of 13 patients with no loss of dopaminergic neurons in striatum as visualized with\nFluorodopa F 18, only 1 patient had this interpretation adequately verified.\n\nAdditionally, the image interpretations were known to the clinicians providing follow-up prior to their\ndetermination of the clinical diagnosis. Because the clinician was responsible for making the\nassessment of the clinical diagnosis, which served as the standard of reference, it is possible that the\nresults of the test influenced their a: s is not acceptable as a standard of reference and is\nnot adequate for support of the proposed visualization claim.\n\nFurthermore, we note that in patients with “positive” images, only 20 patients had a standard of\nreference obtained | year or more following imaging with Fluorodopa F 18. Most patients did not\nhave 1 year of follow-up. This is also inadequate.\n\nThe three readers agreed with each other on the interpretation of the scans in 98% (44 of 45 images)\nof the patients. It is not clear what clinical information was provided to the readers or the amount of\nindependence from each other they had in making the reads.\n\nGoing forward, it is important to develop a plan to address these deficiencies. It will need to include a\nmethod to make a clinical assessment of the patients’ clinical diagnosis that is not influenced by the\nresults of the image reads. This will include obtaining complete follow up on all of the subjects.

Submit the subject-level datasets with the final report.\n\nADDITIONAL COMMENTS\n\nWe have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:\nBecause the benefits of palovarotene for treatment of patients with FOP have not been\nestablished, we are unable to conduct a meaningful benefit risk assessment. The\npalovarotene related risks identified during our review will be considered in the context\nof benefit in your future resubmission. Benefits must outweigh risks for us to approve\nyour application.\n\nOTHER\n\nWithin one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other\nactions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we\nmay consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under\n\n21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the\napplication.\n\nA resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be\nclearly marked with \"RESUBMISSION\" in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the\ncover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider\n\nhis resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial\nresponse to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new\nreview cycle.\n\nYou may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to\n‘ake before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting,\nsubmit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry Formal\nMeetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products.\n\nThe drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing\nhat this application is approved.\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 5100155\n\nNDA 215559\nPage 10\n\nIf you have any questions, call Noreen Cabellon, Regulatory Project Manager, at\n301-796-2899.\n\nSincerely,\n\n{See appended electronic signature page}\n\nLisa B.

Washington Street, Suite 100\nAlexandria, VA 22314\n\nAttention: Kelly T. Boyle\nCFO, Biologics Consulting Group\n\nDear Ms. Boyle:\n\nPlease refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated May 25, 2017, received May 25,\n2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for\nSB4.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we\ncannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\n1. The data and information provided in your response on January 12, and February 14,\n2018, to the Agency’s information requests (IRs) dated December 19, 2017 (IR #13)\nand February 7, 2018 (IR #1) demonstrate that the primary reference standard (PRS)\nwas not appropriately qualified with respect to biological activity (i.e., TNF-a binding\nactivity and TNF-a neutralization activity) and protein concentration, and therefore, is\nnot appropriate for its intended use. Because the PRS was not appropriately\nqualified, the working reference standard (WRS), which was qualified against the\nPRS, is also not appropriate for its intended use. Therefore, there is a lack of\nassurance that the commercial materials are not going to drift from SB4 clinical\nmaterials and the materials used to establish the analytical similarity.\n\na. Generate an appropriately qualified reference material based on the advice\nprovided in the Agency’s IRs dated December 19, 2017 and February 7, 2018.\nUpon the generation of the new qualified reference material, provide data to\nadequately link this material to the materials used in the clinical studies and\nanalytical similarity assessment. We recommend using a two-tiered system\nfor utilizing reference standard material for routine testing of commercial\nproduct.\n\nReference ID: 4238872\n\nBLA 761066\nPage 2\n\nb. Re-assess and revise SB4 drug substance and drug product lot release and\nstability specifications, as appropriate.\n\nc. Re-test the currently manufactured SB4 lots for release and stability using the\nappropriately qualified reference material, as appropriate, if these lots are\nintended to be released for commercial use in the US.\n\nd. Provide an updated requalification protocol for the reference material (e.g.\nprimary and working reference standards) to include the advice that was given\nin the Agency’s information requests dated December 19, 2017, and February\n7, 2018.\n\n2. The data and information provided in the submission and in your response dated\nFebruary 13, 2018, to the Agency’s information request dated February 2, 2018\n\nCharacterization and assessment of\n\nstudy is not considered sufficiently representative of cell culture behavior during the\n\ncommercial cell culture process.

Vaz.\nAssociate VP, GRA-NA\nLilly Corporate Center\nIndianapolis, IN 46285\n\nDear Ana Vaz:\n\nPlease refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received September\n28, 2022, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health\nService Act for lebrikizumab injection.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot\napprove this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\n(1) As part of the facility evaluation of\n\n(b) (4)\n\ndrug substance manufacturing facility, a Remote\nRegulatory Assessment (RRA) was performed. FDA identified issues during the\nRRA and conducted a pre-license inspection (PLI) to further evaluate the facility.\nFollowing the PLI, FDA conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the\nfacility. FDA has reviewed the responses from the facility, and all deficiencies\nhave not been satisfactorily resolved. Satisfactory responses to these\ndeficiencies should be provided to the inspection team prior to submitting your\ncomplete response. Your complete response should include the date of the\nfacility's response to the FDA Form 483. The assessment of the application\napprovability and resolution of inspection deficiencies would be evaluated upon\nreceipt of the complete response and may include a re-inspection of the facility.\nPlease work with the facility in resolving the related deficiencies.\n\n(2) Following evaluation of the inspection findings noted above, and the response to\n\nReference ID: 5252987\n\nthose findings, the Agency has identified concerns regarding the reliability of data\ngenerated at ©® in your BLA submission. The concerns impact\ndata that supports comparability between commercial and clinical materials to\nensure expected clinical outcome demonstrated by clinical material can be\nachieved by commercial material. Further, the adequacy of the proposed\nlebrikizumab drug substance (DS) manufacturing process and overall control\n\nBLA\nPage 2\n\nstrategy cannot be determined at this time to support the licensure of\nlebrikizumab. For resolution, we recommend you engage with an independent\nthird party to develop a protocol for, and conduct, a comprehensive assessment\non the impacted information and data submitted in your application to justify the\nacceptability of using these data and information to support licensure. We\nrecommend you also confirm with the FDA that the protocol is adequate to\nensure that the audit will cover the data reliability concerns identified. If any\nimpacted data are removed from the application and/or changes are made to the\ncontrol strategy to address the facility deficiencies, provide additional information\nand data (e.g., testing results from repeated studies) that are reliable and\naccurate to support that consistent process performance and product quality is\nachieved.\n\nPRESCRIBING INFORMATION\n\n(3) We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise\nadequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the\nPrescription Drug Labeling Resources! and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling\nFinal Rule? websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and\nthe Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) - a checklist of\nimportant format items from labeling regulations and guidances.\n\nCARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING\n\n(4) We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise\nadequate.\n\nPROPRIETARY NAME\n\n(5) Please refer to correspondence dated, December 14, 2022, which addresses the\nproposed proprietary name, Ebglyss.

We strongly recommend that you\nseek the Division’s feedback on any protocol for a future study intended to\nprovide substantial evidence of effectiveness.\n\nThe reasons for our determination that the primary efficacy outcome data are not\ninterpretable are as follows:\n\na) The multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse determination methodology was not\nacceptable for a primary efficacy outcome measure.\n\ni) The Phase 3 study protocol and other materials submitted with your NDA\ndid not include documentation of the process used for relapse\nconfirmation. Only investigator-determined (i.e., protocol-defined and non-\nprotocol-defined), not suspected, relapses were recorded, as you\nconfirmed in your ow , response to IR. As stated in the Study\nMay Proceed Letterfor © |, dated Cy , “there should\nbe a process for documentation of the disposition of all potential relapses\nincluding the dates of the initial clinical assessment and all related\nassessments, identification of the assessor(s), and a final determination of\nwhether the event was considered a relapse... This entire process should\nbe auditable.”\n\nTherefore, the Division was unable to audit the process you utilized for\nrelapse evaluation and could not determine how relapses were confirmed.\nBecause of the lack of accounting of suspected or unconfirmed relapses,\nwe cannot conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of your\nrelapse outcome. Due to an inability to determine how relapses were\ndefined and confirmed, we cannot consider your primary efficacy outcome\nto be interpretable.\n\nii) The window for subject evaluation for potential relapse assessment\nfollowing symptom onset (2 weeks) was unacceptably prolonged. As\nstated in the Study May Proceed Letter for dated\n\n, ‘all subject reports of a possible relapse should be assessed within\nno more than 48 hours of receipt by the site staff. All related assessments\nshould be completed within no more than 72 hours.” A duration of 2 weeks\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 5343048\n\nNDA 218223\nPage 20\n\nc)\n\nbetween symptom onset and relapse assessment could potentially lead to\nrecall bias by the subject. A delay in relapse assessment could also yield\nan uninterpretable Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score if the\nsubject had an examination that took place after spontaneous recovery\nhad occurred or a subject was treated prior to the Treating Investigator’s\nassessment. Our analysis indicates that 25% of subjects in the GA Depot\nand placebo groups who had investigator-determined relapses (as\nidentified in the ADPRIM dataset) were evaluated by the Treating\nInvestigator more than 48 hours after symptoms were reported, with a\nmaximum time to evaluation of 11 days.\n\nThe Treating Investigator was not blinded to the EDSS rater’s\nassessments, which was a potential source of a systematic confirmation\nbias. Though we acknowledge that, per the protocol, disclosure of the\nEDSS score to the Treating Investigator was necessary to determine\nwhether a relapse was protocol-defined, this disclosure is not an\nacceptable approach in clinical trial relapse assessment. The Treating\nInvestigator and EDSS rater should be blinded to each other’s\nassessments for integrity and interpretability of efficacy data.\n\niv) The protocol did not include an independent Relapse Adjudication\nCommittee. Though an independent assessment is not a requirement for\nan adequate and well-controlled study, inclusion of an independent\nRelapse Adjudication Committee is strongly recommended to increase the\nobjectivity of the relapse determination process when there is ambiguity in\na per-protocol relapse assessment. Therefore, in the setting of the other\nconcerns enumerated in this letter, the lack of such a committee in your\ntrial means there is no objective verification of protocol-defined relapses\nand results in the inability to resolve the deficiencies in the relapse\ndetermination pro\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

However,\nas reflected in the final rule on CGMPs for combination products (21 CFR part 4),\nmanufacturers have the option to demonstrate compliance both with the drug CGMP\nregulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211) and with the device quality system (QS)\nregulation (i.e., 21 CFR part 820) through a streamlined approach. In addition, for\ncombination products that include a biological product constituent part, manufacturers\nmust demonstrate compliance with the CGMP requirements specific to biological\nproducts in 21 CFR parts 600 through 680.\n\nIf utilizing a streamlined approach, you must demonstrate compliance (i) with either the\ndrug CGMP regulations or the QS regulation in their entirety and also (ii) with those\nprovisions specified in part 4 from the other of these two sets of requirements.\n\n$ When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic.

However, this information has not been\nreviewed at this time because, based on an assessment of the risk profile of your\nproposed combination product, FDA has determined that information to demonstrate\ncompliance with the device QS regulation is most appropriately assessed during\ninspection rather than reviewed as part of the quality assessment of your application.\nTherefore, this information must be available upon inspection, and assessment of this\ninformation has been deferred for possible review during inspection to demonstrate your\ncompliance with 21 CFR part 4.

We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCLINICAL\n\n1. The two phase 3 studies submitted in this NDA failed to demonstrate acceptable evidence of\nefficacy. The Pearl Index in the larger 13-cycle study (ATI-CL12) was 7.50 with an upper\nbound of the 95% confidence interval of 9.97. The Pearl Index in the smaller 6-cycle study\n(ATI-CL13) was 8.19 with an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of 16.19. Our\ncalculations are based on pregnancies identified as on-treatment. These Pearl Indices and the\nupper bounds of their associated 95% confidence intervals are substantially higher than that\nseen in the registration trials for any of the approved hormonal contraceptives. You attribute\nthese findings to inclusion of subjects in your trials who are more representative of women in\nthe United States who would use the product, if approved. We encourage and value clinical\ntrials that include generalizable populations. However, several of your assertions with regard\nto generalizability are not supported by the available data. In addition, we have identified\nsubstantial problems with study conduct, including low completion rates and issues with\nsubject follow-up and data collection that limit conclusions and our confidence in the study\nresults. We also have no evidence that your product will have a better safety profile than\nother combination hormonal contraceptives to justify accepting the higher Pearl Indices.\n\nReference ID: 3261324\n\nNDA 204017\nPage 2\n\nIn order to address this deficiency, you will need to conduct a new pre-approval phase 3\nstudy in a representative sample of women in the United States who are seeking hormonal\ncontraception. This study will need to demonstrate an acceptable Pearl Index and upper\nbound of the 95% confidence interval. We recommend that the study duration be 13 cycles.\nThe study should use your proposed to-be-marketed product after you have adequately\naddressed the product quality deficiencies (see below) that may have impacted the efficacy\nfindings in your completed studies. We also recommend that you conduct further analyses of\nStudy ATI-CL12 to identify possible explanations for some of the observed findings, such as\nthe clustering of pregnancies at five clinic sites, the impact of incentives for subjects to\nremain in the study, and the adequacy of investigator training. These exploratory analyses\nwill not be sufficient to address our concerns but may yield useful information that can be\nincorporated into the design of your new study.\n\nThe new study should be conducted with rigor and close oversight to ensure that the\nfollowing issues identified in the current submission are minimized or addressed in a timely\n\nmanner:\n\nHigh rates of premature withdrawal from the study and loss to follow-up\nSubject non-compliance with drug use, study visits and study procedures such as\ndaily diary completion, sono\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

Similarly, “false positive”\nHCG results are expected to be rare and should be further evaluated (e.g., confirmation\nby a urine pregnancy test, repeat quantitative serum testing, and ultrasound\nexaminations). Should there be a number of such cases, particularly where further\nfollow-up was not done, this would be a significant review issue.\n\nDiscrepancies between the Investigator and Sponsor interpretations of a pregnancy\nshould be carefully delineated.\n\nIn your new study, a better scoring system for patch adherence should be devised and\ndata should not be dependent on only observation at site visits; data about patch\nadherence should also be recorded in the subject diary, as it is likely to provide data that\nis more accurate and representative of the entire treatment period.\n\nReference ID: 3261324\n\nNDA 204017\nPage 5\n\n8.

Roeloffzen\nDirector, Global Regulatory Affairs\n84 Waterford Drive\n\nMarlborough, MA 01752\n\nDear Ms. Roeloffzen:\n\nPlease refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated March 29, 2018, received March 29,\n2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug,\nand Cosmetic Act for Kynmobi (apomorphine) sublingual film 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, and\n30 mg.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, and have determined that we cannot approve\nthis application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and,\nwhere possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nHUMAN FACTORS (HF)\n\nAs communicated to you in a November 21, 2018, Discipline Review (DR) letter, the human\nfactors (HF) validation study conducted for Kynmobi does not provide sufficient evidence to\ndemonstrate that the proposed product can be used safely and effectively by intended users for its\nintended uses and use environments. Your HF study identified several use errors and close calls\nthat occurred on critical tasks. Additionally, you have not provided data to demonstrate that your\nproposed mitigations are effective and do not introduce new use-related risks. Furthermore, your\nHF study did not evaluate the final intend-to-market user interface, i.e., your proposed\n\n© packaging. Thus, you have not provided sufficient data to demonstrate whether\nthe intended users can open and close the packaging.\n\nWe acknowledge your December 7, 2018, formal response to the DR letter, and note that your\nresponse provided additional information and your plan to address the Agency’s concerns about\nyour human factors (HF) validation study results and the © packaging. We also\nacknowledge that you have evaluated this product in the clinical environment. However, the\nintend-to-market outer carton © packaging) was not part of the user interface\nevaluated in the HF validation study. While we acknowledge your proposed plan to submit a\npetition for exemption from the child-resistant (CR) packaging requirement post-approval |\n© it is not clear whether such exemption will be granted.\n\nReference ID: 4383056\n\nNDA 210875\nPage 2\n\nThe specific deficiencies identified in your HF validation study include the following:\n\n1. Your study results showed several use errors and close calls that occurred on critical\ntasks. We note that you implemented revisions to the Instructions for Use (IFU) and film\npouch (container label) to address the use errors and close calls. However, you did not\nvalidate the revisions to the user interface. Furthermore, our evaluation of the proposed\nuser interface, label and labeling identified areas of vulnerability that may lead to\nmedication errors, and we provided additional recommendations in our November 21,\n2018, Discipline Review letter. We acknowledge that you have implemented our IFU,\ncontainer label, and carton labeling recommendations.\n\n2.

Characterization and control of the aerosol drug\n\nIn the current review cycle, the NDA has not provided adequate characterization\nof the aerosol, including aerosol composition, batch formula, batch data, stability\ndata, identity, strength, purity, delivered dose, generator yield, generator duty\ncycle and generator recertification period. You have not established aerosol\ncritical quality attributes and specifications to ensure the identity, strength,\nquality, purity, or potency of the drug product under 21 CFR 314.50(d) (ii)((a)).\nThis includes attributes, methods and acceptance criteria.\n\nReference ID: 4817078\n\nNDA 022335\nPage 2\n\nTo address this issue, you must develop a quality program to characterize and\ncontrol your Technegas aerosol drug product. Validate your aerosol production\nmethod at the highest and lowest end of the radioactivity range that you load to\nthe crucible and measure particle size distribution, radioactivity of the aerosol\nand yield of the aerosol in this range. Propose and describe analytical methods\nsuitable for their intended purpose, with appropriate validation. Establish\nspecifications and justify acceptance criteria for the critical product quality\nattributes based on data. Submit results from at least three production runs at the\nminimum and maximum radioactivity load of your range.\n\n2.

Also lacking is discussion of breathing instructions for optimal or near-\noptimal risk mitigation and instructions for operators to monitor and prepare\nfor this risk. Therefore, you will need to include the following information in\nyour complete response:\n\na. For each patient breathing method:\n\ni.

We have described below our reasons for this action and, where possible,\nour recommendations to address the issues.\n\nCLINICAL/STATISTICAL\n\nTo support a claim for the treatment of patients with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type I, you submitted\ntwo studies, OT-0401 (a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in HRS type I patients) and TAHRS (a\nsmaller, open-label, cross-over study in HRS type I and II patients). In OT-0401, terlipressin, compared\nto placebo, appeared to show a modest reduction in serum creatinine, but the study failed to show\ndurability of effect. Using the prespecified primary endpoint and the original analytic plan, the results of\nOT-401 were not statistically significant. Your most favorable analysis, using an endpoint developed\npost-hoc with a generally unacceptable redefinition of treatment success, reaches statistical significance,\nbut comes nowhere close to the p-value necessary to support approval based upon a single study. The\nsmaller, open-label TAHRS also failed on its pre-specified primary endpoint and failed to show a\nsustained effect on serum creatinine. In terms of support for the safety of the 14-day terlipressin regimen\nproposed in labeling, your application includes experience in only 11 subjects in study OT-0401 and 9\nsubjects in TAHRS with exposure for 14 days. The extent of exposure is clearly insufficient to support\nthe safety of terlipressin for its intended use. Moreover, although the numbers of adverse events were\nsmall, many important serious adverse events tended to occur more frequently, or earlier (i.e., death), in\nterlipressin-treated subjects, compared to subjects in the respective control groups.\n\nYou will need to conduct at least one additional adequate and well-controlled study to demonstrate the\nefficacy and safety of intravenous terlipressin for the treatment of HRS type I. This study will need to be\nsuccessful, using pre-specified endpoint(s) and analytic plan, at p<0.05. The Division is willing to meet\nwith you to discuss possible trial designs and endpoints that you might wish to consider as alternatives to\nthe endpoint pre-specified in OT-0401, as well as the extent of safety data that should be collected.\n\nNDA 022231 Page 2\nOrphan Therapeutics, LLC\n\nVital Signs: We note that the OT-0401 protocol directed assessment of vital signs at baseline and then\ntwo hours after each dose: in the TAHRS study, vital signs were obtained once each day. and the time of\nassessment relative to administration of study drug was not recorded. Given the brief half-life of\nterlipressin, it appears that there was no assessment of vitals signs during the peak drug effect. In future\ntrial(s), we suggest you obtain vital sign data at peak drug effect, to better characterize the\npharmacodynamic effects of terlipressin.\n\nLaboratory Data: We note that the OT-0401 protocol did not include collection of complete blood counts\nin the monitoring scheme: TAHRS required a complete blood count at baseline, Day 7 and Day 15. For\ncompleteness, we suggest you obtain complete blood counts with leukocyte differential counts and\nplatelet counts should you de\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

You have not provided adequate data to support the safe use of the proposed\nproduct ZIMHI (Naloxone HCI Injection, 5 mg/0.5 mL) pre-filled syringe for the\nemergency treatment of opioid overdose in community settings. The product as\ncurrently designed raises safety concerns for intended users. Specifically, you\nhaven't provided data to demonstrate that intended users are able to deploy needle\nsafety guard without difficulties with the current user interface in the intended use\nenvironments. Failure to deploy the needle safety guard will result in risk of\nneedlestick injury after the injection. Additionally, patients who will be prescribed\nmay have familiarity with your product. However, the intended users could include\nlaypersons, who may administer this to patients. Your product, if approved, is\nanticipated to be widely used in community settings by laypersons who are not\nfamiliar with the use of the product at all. There is possibility that your product will be\nused on patients with an increased rate of bloodborne pathogens disease than the\ngeneral public’. Potential risks of transmission of bloodborne pathogens from opioid-\n\n| https://www.cdc.gov/pwid/index.html\n\nReference ID: 4701652\n\nNDA 212854\nPage 2\n\noverdose patients to the intended users are high for your product. Your current user\ninterface is not adequate to mitigate potential risks of needlestick injury and prevent\nrisks of transmission of bloodborne pathogens from opioid-overdose patients to the\nintended users.\n\nTo address this deficiency\n\nModify your device to include an automatically deploying needle safety element to\ndecrease the risk of needlestick injury (to avoid transmission of bloodborne\npathogens).\n\nSubmit your updated comprehensive use-related risk analysis (URRA) taking into\nconsideration the changes to the user interface. The comprehensive use-related risk\nanalysis should include a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of all the steps\ninvolved in using your product (e.g., based on a task analysis) the errors that users\nmight commit or the tasks they might fail to perform and the potential negative\nclinical consequences of use errors and task failures.\n\nYour risk analysis should also discuss risk-mitigation strategies you employed to\nreduce risks you have identified and the methods you intend to use for validating the\nrisk-mitigation strategies. This information is needed to ensure that all potential risks\ninvolved in using your product have been considered and adequately mitigated and\nthe residual risks are acceptable.\n\nBased on this risk analysis, you will need to submit the results of a human factors\n(HF) validation study conducted under simulated use conditions with representative\nusers performing necessary tasks to demonstrate safe and effective use of the\nproduct.\n\nWe recommend you submit your HF validation study protocol for feedback from the\nAgency before commencing your study.

D’Emanuele\n50 South Sixth Street, Suite 1500\nMinneapolis, MN 55402-1498\n\nDear Dr. D’Emanuele:\n\nPlease refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 26, 2013, received March\n27, 2013, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for RizaFilm (rizatriptan) oral film 10 mg.\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated September 26, 2019, which\nconstituted a complete response to our March 28, 2019, action letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined\nthat we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nthese issues.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\n1) With respect to the manufacturing process:\n\nReference ID: 4580538\n\nNDA 205394\nPage 2\n\n2) With respect to drug product stability:\n\nWe acknowledge the out of specification (OOS) investigations submitted in response\nto the September 26, 2019, action letter. However, due to the manufacturing\nprocess deficiencies described in Item 1 above, we have determined that stability\ndata obtained from testing of the existing exhibit batches cannot be used as primary\ndata for establishment of product shelf life. Therefore, we recommend the following:\na) Submit 12 months of long-term stability data for exhibit batches manufactured as\nrecommended in Comment 1. Stability testing should be performed using fully\nvalidated methods and the suitability of analytical equipment should be verified\nprior to use. The product shelf life assigned will be based on review of this\nstability data.\nb) If you intend to use the 2017 or 2018 batch stability results as supportive data,\nprovide the raw HPLC data for all corrected analytical results. Additionally,\nregarding INV-2019-017, in order to support disqualification of the OOS stability\nresults obtained using © for analysis of this\nproduct, further investigation is needed to identify the root cause.\n\nFACILITY INSPECTIONS\n\n3) During a recent inspection of the a\ndrug substance manufacturing facility for this NDA, our field investigator observed\nobjectionable conditions at the facility and conveyed that information to the\nrepresentative of the facility at the close of the inspection.

(FEI 3005721224) for oral film\nproducts, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions at the drug product\nmanufacturing facility. In addition, during the review of the submission dated\n09/26/2019, we are recommending manufacture of new exhibit batches tested in\naccordance with cGMPs. Please note that that this information will be reviewed by\nthe Agency during the review of the application and a follow up Pre approval\ninspection may be needed to verify that the facility has taken necessary corrective\nactions to ensure oral film product quality.\n\nPRESCRIBING INFORMATION\n\nWe reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise\nadequate.

In the information request response dated June 3, 2024,\nyou agreed to commit to perform a real-time/real-condition shipping validation\nstudy and to submit the data in a future annual report. Submitting the shipping\nvalidation data without an approved shipping validation protocol for prospective\nvalidation of the actual commercial drug product shipping to a future annual\nreport is inappropriate because product quality cannot be ensured during the\nactual commercial drug product shipment. Therefore, in your resubmission, we\nrecommend you provide drug product real-time/real-condition shipping validation\ndata.\n\nDevice\n\n4.

You may incorporate applicable sections of\nthe amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited\nin this letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined\nthat we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nthese issues.\n\nFACILITY INSPECTIONS\n\n1. During a recent inspection of Tanvex, Inc. manufacturing facility (FEI: 3013021112)\nfor this BLA, our field investigators conveyed deficiencies to the representatives of\nthe facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this\napplication may be approved.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\nComparative Analytical Assessment\n\n2. During the April 23-May 2, 2019 inspection of the non-GMP laboratory at Tanvex,\nInc. (FEI: 3013021112) that conducted most of the comparative analytical studies,\nseveral issues were raised regarding data analysis and management, and the\nsuitability of the comparative analytical assays. These issues may negatively impact\nthe reliability of the data provided to demonstrate that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-\nlicensed Neupogen. For example:\n\nReference ID: 4496557\n\nBLA 761126\nPage 2\n\na. some of the assays used in the 2016 study were not qualified, and formal\nsystem suitability criteria were not in place at the time of use;\n\nb. considerable issues were raised regarding documentation of data and\nomission of data from analysis for the competitive ELISA binding assay;\n\nc. multiple changes were made to RP-HPLC data without documented\njustification, including deletion of an injection containing raw data as\ndocumented in the audit trail;\n\nd. lack of documentation of the method procedures followed for determining the\nprotein concentration of U.S-licensed Neupogen in the 2016 similarity study;\n\ne. missing notebook record for analysis of TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen by\nRP-HPLC during the 2016 similarity study; and\n\nf. lack of written retesting procedures to manage “exceptional conditions”.\n\nOverall, these issues raise concerns regarding the quality of the comparative analytical\n\ndata submitted in your 351(k) BLA. Therefore, at this time, there is insufficient\ninformation to make a determination that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed\nNeupogen notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components.\n\nFor the Agency to make an assessment of the application, it is critical that the data\n\nprovided in your 351(k) BLA are reliable and complete. To address this deficiency, you\nwill need to perform an appropriate retrospective review of all the comparative analytical\ndata to ensure its reliability and completeness. The retrospective review is necessary to\nsupport a determination that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Neupogen. This\nretrospective review may rely on your own internal audit or you may need to identify an\nappropriately qualified, external third party to perform an independent and thorough\naudit of all the comparative analytical sources and data used to support your 351(k)\nBLA for reliability and completeness.

We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nthese issues.\n\nCLINICAL\n\nWe have concluded that your application does not provide sufficient data for the\nDivision to approve your application for the proposed indication of treatment of negative\nsymptoms of schizophrenia because of the following deficiencies briefly outlined below:\n\n(1) You have not established substantial evidence of effectiveness (SEE) for the effects\nof roluperidone on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Study MINI-101C03\n(Study C03) demonstrated statistical significance on the primary efficacy endpoint.\nHowever, this study is insufficient on its own to establish SEE. The phase 3 study\nMIN-101C07 (Study C07) was a negative study using the pre-specified statistical\nanalyses, regardless of exclusion of the study site with data irregularities (Study Site\n\nReference ID: 5335697\n\nNDA 217002\nPage 2\n\nom ). The Division considered your proposal that, although negative on\n\nthe prespecified primary endpoint, Study C07 may contribute to SEE based on “the\nappropriateness of the multiplicity correction used, the consistency of results across\nmost secondary endpoints reflecting improvement in daily function, the findings of\nthe exposure-response modeling, the treatment effect seen beginning at Week 4,\nand the consistency of results between Studies C03 and C07.” However, following\nsubstantive review of Study C07, the Division concluded that the results from the\nposthoc analysis using a multiple testing procedure that was not prespecified and\nfrom other exploratory analyses that you proposed were not sufficiently robust to\novercome the lack of a positive result on the prespecified primary analysis, the\nmixed results on the secondary and exploratory endpoints, and uncertainties\nregarding the clinical meaningfulness of the result and fitness-for-purpose of the\nprimary endpoint.\n\n(2) The NDA submission lacks data on concomitant antipsychotic administration. The\nDivision considered your position that the proposed use of roluperidone is as\nmonotherapy for individuals who have stable positive symptoms and do not require\ncontinuous treatment with antipsychotics and, therefore, that “the information\nnecessary to prescribers to decide how roluperidone should be used and how to\nmanage potential risks is a topic for review and consideration of the labeling,\npotentially including a limitation of use, contraindications, and/or warnings.”\nHowever, the Division concluded that data regarding the impact on the safety and\nefficacy of roluperidone when administered with an antipsychotic would be needed\nto determine whether the potential benefits of roluperidone could outweigh the risks.\nCurrent standard of care treatment for schizophrenia includes ongoing treatment\nwith antipsychotic medications. There are substantial risks associated with untreated\npositive symptoms, and co-administration with an antipsychotic would be expected if\npatients experience worsening of positive symptoms.

The submitted safety database included an\ninadequate number of subjects exposed to roluperidone at the proposed dose (64\nmg) for at least 12 months.

You must provide additional data\nto demonstrate the safety and efficacy of roluperidone coadministered with\nantipsychotic medications, to support that observed effect on negative symptoms with\nroluperidone treatment corresponds to a clinically meaningful change, and to\ndemonstrate the long-term safety of the proposed dose. The Division expects that data\nfrom U.S. subjects will contribute to these additional efficacy and safety data. We\nrecommend that you discuss the design of any additional planned study or studies with\nthe Agency prior to study initiation.\n\nCLINICAL/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\nRoluperidone and BFB-520 are associated with concentration-dependent QTc\nprolongation. You have not developed a strategy sufficient to reliably identify patients in\nthe intended population who would be at greatest risk of QT interval prolongation with\nroluperidone. The proposed method for identifying patients by CYP2D6 genotype and\nphenotype is not appropriate given that the CYP2D6 phenotype assignments used in\nthe development program are not consistent with current phenotyping and testing\nstandards.\n\nTo mitigate the risk of QTc prolongation, you have proposed that roluperidone should\nonly be administered after CYP2D6 genotyping results are available and only to patients\nwho have at least one CYP2D6 normal function allele (e.g., *1, *2, *35). You propose a\ncontraindication in patients who lack at least one CYP2D6 normal function allele which\nyou define as CYP2D6 intermediate and poor metabolizers (hereafter abbreviated IMs\nand PMs, respectively).\n\nHowever, your definition of CYP2D6 IMs and PMs (patients who lack at least one\nCYP2D6 normal function allele) is not consistent with standard phenotype definitions,\nwhich use activity scores. In our analyses of reclassified CYP2D6 phenotype using\nstandard phenotype definitions, CYP2D6 IMs were enrolled in Studies C03 and C07\n(~33-37% of study populations) and almost all CYP2D6 IMs have an activity score equal\nto 1. Based on the available data, there are potential safety risks in CYP2D6 IMs across\nthe entire range of activity scores.

The PK is also impacted significantly in the presence\nof CYP2D6 inhibitors. The impairment of hepatic function is anticipated to increase\nsystemic exposures of roluperidone and its major metabolite, BFB-520, and may\npose safety risks to patients on therapy. A dedicated safety and PK study in patients\nwith impaired hepatic function will ultimately be warranted to adequately inform\nproduct labeling. You may consider a reduced design hepatic impairment study in\npatients with moderate hepatic impairment.\n\n(2) The radiolabeled mass balance study suggests that approximately 1% of\nadministered oral dose of roluperidone is excreted unchanged in urine. This\nsuggests that roluperidone undergoes substantial disposition through non-renal\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 5335697\n\nNDA 217002\nPage 9\n\nmediated pathways. Given that uremic toxins could impact the non-renal mediated\ndisposition, a dedicated safety and PK study in patients with impaired renal function\nwill ultimately be warranted to adequately inform product labeling. We recommend\nthat you evaluate the safety and PK of roluperidone in a reduced design renal\nimpairment study in patients with severe renal impairment.\n\n(3) Based on our analysis, roluperidone and BFB-520 are associated with\nconcentration-dependent QTc prolongation, which is consistent with the available\nnonclinical data. In any future submission, we therefore recommend that you revise\nyour proposed label to describe the increase in QTc following the recommendations\nin the draft guidance for industry titled “QTc Information in Human Prescription Drug\nand Biological Product Labeling” (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-\nfda-guidance-documents/qtc-information-human-prescription-drug-and-biological-\nproduct-labeling). The description of the QTc increase in section 12.2 should be\nbased on study MIN-101C08 and analyzed using exposure-response following the\nrecommendations described in “Scientific white paper on concentration-QTc\nmodeling” (Garnett, C. et al., J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 2017; doi\n10.1007/s10928-017-9558-5) and “Correction to: Scientific white paper on\nconcentration-QTc modeling” (Garnett, C. et al., J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn\n2018; doi 10.1007/s10928-017-9565-6).\n\n(4) The submitted population PK model underpredicts Cmax of roluperidone. In your\nresubmission, you should refine the population PK model to improve the prediction\nof roluperidone Cmax.\n\nCLINICAL\n\n(1) We acknowledge receipt of your oe submissions\nproviding information about data for the ongoing Study MIN-101C18, “A Phase 1b,\nInpatient Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamics, and\nPharmacokinetics of the Coadministration of Roluperidone and Olanzapine in Adult\nSubjects with Moderate to Severe Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia.” These\nsubmissions will not be reviewed in the cur\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by\nspecific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we\ncannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCLINICAL\n\n1. You have failed to demonstrate replicative efficacy in two pivotal clinical simulation studies,\nbased on the previously agreed upon primary endpoints and statistical analyses. Study EM-\n05-012760 passed on all primary efficacy analyses; however, Study EM-05-013260 did not\npass the > 70% responder rate primary endpoint for the inguinal site. Thus, replicative\nefficacy was demonstrated for the abdominal site, but replicative efficacy was not\ndemonstrated for the inguinal site. We have previously communicated to you (IND 076549,\nAdvice/Information Request, April 17, 2015) that your proposed alternative primary efficacy\nanalyses to be conducted in the event that the positive control fails to meet the 70% threshold\nare not acceptable.\n\nConduct a repeat study of the inguinal region with adequate controls that meets the pre-\nspecified primary endpoint.\n\n2. The financial disclosure information provided in the NDA is not sufficient. Eleven of 20\nsubinvestigators listed on the revised 1572 for pivotal study EM-05-012760 are missing\ndisclosure information. Also, one of the five subinvestigators is missing financial disclosure\n\nReference ID: 3927975\n\nNDA 208288\nPage 2\n\ninformation for study EM-05-013260. The guidance for industry (E6) Good Clinical Practice\nGuidance: Consolidated Guidance, section 8.2,\n\n(http://www. fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/ucm073122.pdf) indicates that this\ninformation should be documented before the trial starts formally. Financial arrangements\nbetween investigators and the sponsor can introduce bias in trial data that may be difficult to\nevaluate. In addition to the potential impact on efficacy outcome data, this is an issue of\nstudy conduct.\n\nDescribe your efforts to obtain financial disclosure both before and after the trial. Discuss\nthe potential impact lack of financial disclosure may have on data integrity, especially\nefficacy data in the pivotal trials. Provide specific information regarding the role of each\nsubinvestigator in the trials and whether that role had any involvement in determination or\ndocumentation of outcome data. In order to evaluate the possible impact on efficacy\noutcomes, identify how many subjects each subinvestigator had a role with during the trial.\nTo the extent feasible for a single center trial, submit analyses dropping the subjects of all\nsubinvestigators without financial disclosure per pivotal trial. Provide datasets for each\npivotal trial that allow independent verification of the sensitivity analyses, (i.e. the\nsubinvestigator is named for each subject by “usubjid” in efficacy datasets for each study).\nAs a subinvestigator may have participated in more than one trial, for each trial in the NDA\nindicate whether there is missing subinvestigator information, list the missing\nsubinvestigator(s), and provide a listing of\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

Moreover, you did not detect defects of any\nsize in the 26 ml DP filled ampules. Further, the information presented indicates that\nyour selected test method is only capable of detecting holes of 50 um or greater, which,\nper the USP 1207.1 you previously provided, corresponds to an air leak rate of > 0.360\nstandard cc per second (sccs). Kirsch, et. al. (also referenced in the Parenteral Drug\nAssociation’s Technical Report 27) demonstrated that a leakage rate that correlates with\nmicrobial ingress is approximately 10° sccs, which is considerably lower than what your\nresults demonstrate. With the low detection rate demonstrated by positive controls, and\nwithout further information to correlate your proposed method with the potential for\nmicrobial ingress, the method that you propose is not acceptable as a CCIT method.\n\nProvide CCIT results from a validated testing method capable of detecting microbial\ningress in order to demonstrate the integrity of the proposed container closure system\n(glass ampules) for the DP.\n\n2.

We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCLINICAL\n\nThe submitted data do not provide a favorable benefit-risk balance to support the use of inhaled\nmannitol in patients with cystic fibrosis 6 years of age and older. The determination of efficacy\nbased on the two submitted trials are not adequate because of the treatment-related frequent early\ndropouts in trial 301 for which the primary statistical analyses did not account and the lack of\nstatistical significance in trial 302 for the primary endpoint. Sensitivity analyses conducted on\ndata from study 301 either fail to confirm a treatment effect on the primary efficacy or are\nproblematic in that they attribute a good outcome to some patients who discontinue treatment or\nthey impute a single score without accounting properly for variability. In addition, there was lack\nof support for efficacy from secondary endpoints in both the studies. Assessment of safety\nfindings show that, compared to control, subjects treated with mannitol 400 mg had a high\noccurrence of hemoptysis, particularly in pediatric patients, which is concerning and does not\nbalance favorably with the submitted efficacy data, especially in the pediatric population.\n\nTo support approval of inhaled mannitol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, conduct a clinical\n\nprogram including at least one adequate clinical trial to show substantial evidence of efficacy in\npatients with cystic fibrosis and balancing safety findings. In order to better balance benefit to\n\nReference ID: 3277790\n\nNDA 202049\nPage 2\n\ntisk, consider:1) changing the threshold for passing for the mannitol tolerance test to make it\nmore conservative, 2) including a lower dose of mannitol in addition to the dose that was studied,\nand 3) testing efficacy and safety initially in adults and later in children informed by data from\nadults. In the clinical trial include specified criteria that address the specific safety concern of\nhemoptysis.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\nDuring an inspection on OM of the y\npackaging and labeling facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed\n\ncurrent Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) deficiencies to the representative of the facility.\n\nSatisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may be approved.\n\nLABELING\n\n6.

Therefore, the\napplication is not approvable under section 505(d) of the Act and 21 CFR 314.125(b). The\ndeficiencies are summarized as follows:\n\nNonapproval Deficiencies\n\nYou have still not, in our view, provided substantial evidence of the effectiveness of gepirone ER\nin the short-term or longer-term treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We\nacknowledge our earlier discussion with you on July 3, 2002, at which time we agreed that you\nhad produced evidence of short-term efficacy for gepirone ER in study 134001 and for gepirone\nIR in study 03A7A-003. At that meeting, you indicated that the results from another short-term\nER study (134004) would soon be available, as well as results from a longer-term randomized\nwithdrawal study (28709). We indicated that, if study 134004 were robustly positive, you would\nhave sufficient efficacy data for filing the application. We subsequently learned, however, in an\nApril 17, 2003 package outlining your proposed response to our March 15, 2002 nonapprovable\nletter, that study 134004 failed to distinguish gepirone from placebo. Although at first glance,\nthe failure of fluoxetine to show superiority to placebo suggests that study 134004 lacked assay\nsensitivity, fluoxetine was in fact nearly significantly superior to gepirone, a very unusual\noutcome in comparisons of two active antidepressants and a more troubling result. You\nindicated, however, that your randomized withdrawal study (28709) was positive, and argued\n\n\nNDA 21-164\nPage 2\n\nthat this combination of two positive short-term studies, one for each of the two formulations,\ntogether with one positive gepirone ER long-term study, should be sufficient to file the\napplication. In a July 14, 2003 teleconference, we agreed only that we would probably be\nwilling to file such an application, without reaching any agreement that this combination of\nstudies would represent sufficient support of the effectiveness of gepirone. We noted that part of\nthe difficulty was a preponderance of negative studies for gepirone in the application, making the\noverall program very weak indeed.\n\nNow that we have had an opportunity to review the data for study 28709, we do not agree that it\nis a positive study. It was a fairly typical randomized withdrawal study in adult depression\n(MDD), with an 8-12 week open label phase, followed by a double-blind phase in which patients\nresponding to open treatment with gepirone (HAMD-17 total score < 8, at week 8 or week 12)\nwere randomized to either continuation of gepirone (at the same dose that was associated with a\n“response”) or to placebo, with a 40-44 week period of observation for relapse (defined as a\nHAMD-17 > 16, or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy as determined by the investigator).\nThe primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had relapsed at the end of the\nobservation period, and the primary analysis was the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (CMH), with\nadjustment for centers. Time to relapse was a secondary endpoint. Survival curves were\nestimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology and the log-rank test was used to compare survival\ndistributions.

In fact, you have produced an internal memo, prepared prior to\nunblinding, indicating that these patients would be redefined as having relapsed, and they\nwere so redefined. Subsequent to unblinding and analysis, you discovered that these\npatients’ scores had not met the > 16 criterion, but it was too late to query investigators, since\nthey had also been unblinded. Nevertheless, you then decided to exclude the patients as\nrelapsers, on the grounds that the redefinition had not been done by formal amendment and it\nhad not been possible to query investigators. As it turns out, this redefinition is critical to the\noutcome, since, if these 5 patients are included as relapsers, the results are as follows:\n\n\nNDA 21-164\nPage 3\n\nGepirone: 34/126 (27%)\nPlacebo: 43/124 (35%) p=0.101\n\nWe consider it inappropriate, after looking at the results of the analysis, to decide not to\ninclude these patients as relapsers, when they had already been quite reasonably reclassified\nas relapsers by you prior to unblinding the data. It seems obvious, on face, that these 5\npatients who were discontinued for worsening depression should be counted as relapsers,\ngiven that their discontinuations were for “worsening of depression,” whether or not there\nwas an opportunity to query the investigators to try to verify this result. Thus, we believe the\nappropriate analysis is the one that includes these 5 patients as having relapsed.\n\n2. Failure to include all ITT patients in the analysis\n\nWe also note that you excluded 32 patients from the analysis (CMH) because they came from\ncenters that had patients in only | treatment arm, or had no relapses. A more appropriate\nanalysis, grouping these centers, gives a nonsignificant result: p=0.10, with grouping of small\ncenters; p=0.08, with grouping by country. These results are negative, even with your\nexclusion of the 5 relapsed patients we feel should be included. When these 5 patients are\nincluded in these analyses with appropriate grouping of centers, the results are far from\nsignificant (p=0.33 and p=0.31, respectively, for groupings by small center and by country).\n\nThe results on the secondary endpoint, time to relapse, also did not favor gepirone, with a p-\nvalue of 0.089. When the additional 5 patients are included, the p-value is 0.28. Generally for\nthis type of study, we consider the time to relapse analysis as the more appropriate analysis, and\nthe one that we always recommend. The CMH analysis of proportion relapsed does not properly\naddress censored patients, in that it implicitly treats them as successes.\n\nThe finding of only two positive short-term trials for gepirone, one for IR (03A7A-003) and one\nfor ER (134001), out of a total of 19 short-term placebo controlled trials is a significant concern.\nWhile we have accepted your explanation for the failure of many of these trials, we noted in our\nMarch 15, 2002 letter that 3 of the short-term ER studies appeared adequate, on face, and would\nave been expected to succeed. Thus, the finding of only one of four adequately designed short-\nterm ER studies having a positive outcome was not reassuring.

The result of the\nmost recent ER study (134004) adds to our concern. Although this study is on face a failure for\noth fluoxetine and gepirone, it actually favors fluoxetine over gepirone. The results for\ngepirone are actually numerically worse than placebo, while the results for fluoxetine are\nnumerically superior to placebo, and the p-value for the fluoxetine/gepirone contrast on the\nrimary outcome (HAMD-25) is strongly trending toward statistical significance (p=0.068).\nThus, of 5 short-term seemingly well- designed ER studies, only one of the five was positive.\nGiven this very marginal set of results for the gepirone short-term efficacy data, a robustly\nositive result for the randomized withdrawal study became even more pressing. As noted, we\ndo not consider 28709 to be a positive study.\n\nIn summary, you have not provided substantial evidence that gepirone ER is effective in the\ntreatment of MDD. While it is true that you have provided evidence of an effect from 2 short-\n\nNDA 21-164\nPage 4\n\nterm studies, these used 2 different formulations (1 for IR and 1 for ER). We do not find these\ndata sufficient to support the effectiveness of gepirone ER. The negative outcome on study\n28709, which used a randomized withdrawal design that regularly is successful in showing the\neffectiveness of effective agents, further weakens what evidence there was to support an\nantidepressant claim for gepirone ER. Furthermore, as the negative data continue to accumulate,\nit becomes difficult to advise you on what further work you might do to addr such a\npreponderance of negativity. At this point, we would want at least a “robustly positive” short-\nterm trial with gepirone ER and a positive randomized withdrawal study. The short-term trial\nshould look at different fixed doses of gepirone ER, and the randomized withdrawal study would\nneed to involve a period of “response” for a minimum of 6 months before randomization.\n\nAdditionally, we have the following comments and requests that will need to be addressed in\nyour resubmission.\n\nProposed Tradename\n\nOur Division of Medication Errors and Technical Support (DMETS) has completed their review\nof your proposed tradenames of \"Variza\" and \"Alrize\".

You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific\nreference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we\ncannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\n\nWe acknowledge that the data from your bioequivalence (BE) studies establish that your product\nis bioequivalent to Keppra XR in the fasted state. However, examination of the data from your\ntwo BE studies in the fed state (Studies 131 and 272) reveals that a substantial percent of patients\nhave plasma concentration-time curves that differ significantly between your product and Keppra\nXR, despite the observation that in Study 272, your product meets bioequivalence criteria for\nCmax and AUC. As you know, the Division considers similarity of the overall shapes of these\ncurves to be an important factor in deciding that two products will have similar safety and\neffectiveness.\n\nAlthough you provided simulations suggesting that the two products are likely to be\nbioequivalent at steady state (based on AUC and Cmax), the simulations provided did not\n\nReference ID: 3284892\n\nNDA 204417\nPage 2\n\ndemonstrate that the individual plasma concentration-time profiles after administration of your\ndrug at steady state would be similar in shape to that of Keppra XR.\n\nAlthough you claim that, based on the Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Review for\nKeppra XR® (levetiracetam), “the range of trough concentrations resulting in subjects with\nprolonged pattern of release fall within the range of observed trough concentrations of 4.6-21\n\nmg/mL in responders at 12-hour with Keppra,” oa)\n\n(4)\n\n© \"Tn addition, under\nSection 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act, a sponsor may not reference the information contained in an\nFDA review of the Reference Listed Drug (RLD); the Agency can only rely on the specific\ninformation contained in the label of the RLD.\n\n(b) (4)\n\n®® ‘In conclusion, you have not provided\nevidence that the observed differences in the shape of the plasma concentration-time profiles in a\nsubstantial percent of patients after administration of your product with food will not affect the\nefficacy or safety of your product.\n\nIn addition, because we have found that the 1500 mg tablet does not perform similarly to Keppra\nXR, we cannot approve your 1000 mg tablet based on a waiver of the bioequivalence\nrequirement for that strength.\n\nIn addition, the 1500 mg tablet showed dose dumping potential at the highest alcohol\nconcentration’ in the in vitro studies. The labeling of the RLD does not have a statement\nlimiting alcohol use. The Division is concerned that adding an alcohol use limitation to the label\nfor your proposed ER formulation could lead to clinical consequences similar to those described\nabove regarding fed/fasting administration.

We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nFACILITY INSPECTIONS\n\n1. An inspection of the Kashiv Biosciences LLC DS manufacture facility (FEI\n3011289655), Chicago, Illinois, is required before this application can be approved\nas the FDA must assess the ability of that facility to conduct the listed manufacturing\noperations in compliance with CGMP. Due to restrictions on travel, we were unable\nto conduct an inspection during the current review cycle for your application. While\nyou may respond to deficiencies in this Complete Response Letter while the travel\nrestrictions remain in effect, please note that the application cannot be approved\nuntil the required FDA inspection is conducted and any findings are assessed with\nregard to your application.\n\nFor more information, please see the FDA guidances related to the Coronavirus\nDisease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency.”\n\n!

We understand that you identified © as the third-party to audit your\nquality data and systems to support BLA 761082. However, it is unclear whether the\n™® audit reviewed all the quality data submitted in the BLA because the! audit\ncovered data mainly generated during the years 2015-2017 and the clinical DP lots\n40-13013 and 45-14042 were manufactured on November 9, 2013 and July 19,\n2014, respectively. Also, it is not clear whether there are source data traceability\nissues in the comparative analytical assessment including lots used in clinical\nstudies submitted in the BLA. The audit team reported (see pages 596-7 of\n“Response to Retrospective Review of the GMP Systems and Product Quality Data\nof Theragrastim by!

SDS-PAGE data for the clinical lot 45-14042 manufactured on July 19, 2014\nwere not available for review during the audit.\n\nThe Theragrastim lots for which source data are not traceable should not be included in\nthe comparative analytical assessment. To address this deficiency:\n\na. Provide a table listing all lots, tests performed with those lots, and the dates of\ntesting that were retrospectively reviewed during the | audit.\n\nb. Identify results that were included in the comparative analytical assessment\nbut cannot be traced back to the source.\n\nc. Remove untraceable data from the comparative analytical assessment.

In your response to the June 11, 2019, complete response (CR) item # 3, you\nreported the detection of two sequence variants, S77-R77 and G101-R101 from a\npeak (CEX-P6) separated using the CEX-HPLC method. However, you did not\nprovide an explanation for the etiology of the sequence variants or whether the\nsequence variants impact the conclusions reached in your comparative analytical\nassessment. To address this deficiency, provide an explanation for the sequence\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 4721287\n\nBLA 761082\nPage 4\n\nvariants, and whether the variants impact a determination that Theragrastim is highly\nsimilar to US-licensed Neupogen. Depending on the etiology of the sequence\nvariants and their impact on a determination that Theragrastim is highly similar to\nUS-licensed Neupogen, you may need to develop a strategy to control or remove\nthese sequence variants in Theragrastim.\n\nIn-House Reference Standards\n\n4. The stability protocols PTL-1981 “Stability Protocol for Theragrastim Primary\nReference Standard ™® «Stability Protocol for\nTheragrastim Working Reference Standard” are deficient because there are no\nacceptance criteria established to control for EC50 values. To address this\ndeficiency, update the stability protocols for in-house primary and working reference\nstandards to include adequate control over EC50. Because you have not established\na working reference standard (WRS) and you have been using the primary reference\nstandard (PRS) in QC testing, you should perform a trending analysis of the EC50\nvalues obtained during routine release and stability testing to establish a stability\nacceptance criterion for the PRS. After a WRS has been established and used in QC\ntesting, you may use a similar strategy to establish a stability acceptance criterion for\nthe WRS. Provide a detailed description of how you propose to perform this trend\nanalysis and how the acceptance criterion is going to be defined.\n\nPost-Approval Stability Protocol\n\n5. We noted deficiencies in your stability specifications and stability protocols for\nTheragrastim DP. The DP stability protocols listed in section 3.2.P.8.2. indicate to\ntest for syringe break loose and glide force determination and follow specifications\nper SPC-0031 “Theragrastim Drug Product (DP) Specification”. However, we noted\nthat SPC-0031 does not list stability specifications for this quality attribute. Also, we\nnoted you schedule to test container closure integrity (CCI) only at the 12-month\ntime-point but not at the 24-month time-point. To address these deficiencies:\n\na. update the DP stability specifications to assess for syringe break loose and\nglide force, and\n\nb. modify the DP post-approval stability protocols to include CCI testing at the\n24-month time-point.\n\nShipping Validation Protocol\n\n6. We noted the following deficiencies in the shipping performance qualification\nprotocols PTL 2079 and PTL-2080 for the DP in vials and pre-filled syringes:\n\na. You proposed to use the lower filling volumes in the shipping validation\nstudies without providing adequate justification that the lower filling volumes\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 4721287\n\nBLA 761082\nPage 5\n\nrepresent worst-case scenarios, and it is inconsistent with your response to\nJune 11, 2019, CR item # 25, that the higher filling volumes will be used in the\nshipping validation studies.\n\nb.

Given the\nserious risks of Melblez Kit treatment, we recommend that you perform an adequate and\nwell-controlled randomized trial(s) to establish the safety and efficacy of the Melblez Kit\nusing overall survival as the primary efficacy outcome measure. You should ensure that\nthe trial is designed to ensure applicability of the results from this(these) trial(s) to the\nUnited States (US) population. The design, conduct, and results of this trial will\ndetermine whether one additional trial will be sufficient to support a marketing approval.\n\n2.

This plan should describe the data to be used, the analysis\nplan, and the timeline, including key milestones, for submission of this information.\n\n20. Based on the observed toxicity profile obtained with the clinical trial version of the\nMelblez Kit at the proposed dose of 3 mg/kg IBW, we recommend that additional clinical\ntrials be conducted to explore the potential efficacy of a lower dose of melphalan and of a\nlonger filtration time to reduce systemic exposure following completion of the melphalan\n\nReference ID: 3372401\n\nNDA 201848\nPage 11\n\ninfusion (i.e., filtration for longer than 30 minutes following completion of the melphalan\ninfusion).

The NDA did not contain the results of genotoxicity testing of the Gen 2 filter and the\nnew extracorporeal circuit components according to ISO 10993-3:2003 nor did it contain\nadequate justification that such testing is not necessary based on comparable leachable\nprofiles of the filter and extracorporeal circuit components of the two configurations and\nnegligible concerns with genotoxicity of your device based on a toxicological risk\nassessment. Since the device components of the Melblez Kit are considered to be an\nexternal communicating device with limited contact with circulating blood during each\ntreatment, in accordance with the FDA blue book memo G#95-1, genotoxicity testing of\nyour device is recommended. The genotoxicity testing of device components used in the\nclinical trial version of this product is not sufficient to address this recommendation\nbecause of the different filters used in the clinical trial version (Gen 1) and in the product\nyou intend to market (Gen 2). Since the Gen 1 and 2 filters are manufactured by different\nmanufacturers, a different manufacturing process and source of materials may lead to\ndifferent leachable profiles of your device, qualitatively and quantitatively.\n\n23. | The NDA contains insufficient information to fully characterize the hemocompatibility of\nthe device components in the proposed commercial product.

The non-clinical studies that\nevaluated the hemocompatibility of the Gen 2 filter included an invalid control, i.e., the\nGEN] filter, and data on all effects, especially those not resulting in specific toxic effects,\nwere not reported.\n\na. We recommend that non-clinical studies of adequate design be conducted to\nevaluate the hemodynamic effects of the device components of your proposed\ncommercial product. In these non-clinical studies, the control should be a sham.\ncontrol, either an FDA cleared, approved predicate, or reference device, or both,\nand the study should be conducted without administration of melphalan to isolate\neffects attributable to the device component of the proposed commercial product.\n\nReference ID: 3372401\n\nNDA 201848\nPage 12\n\nAssessments should be obtained at multiple, different time points, with a specific\nplan for histopathological examination of major organs, examination of thrombus\nformation, and close monitoring to characterize cardiovascular adverse event\nrates.\n\nb.

We have described our reasons for this\naction below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nCLINICAL / STATISTICAL\n\nYour application contains no data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials. Significant\ndeficiencies have been identified in the referenced literature studies and in the studies you have\nconducted in support of this application. The data submitted in your application are not sufficient\nfor evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness and usefulness of Fluorodopa F 18 PET in the proposed\npatient population.\n\n1. The following deficiencies have been identified with clinical Study #15, which was\nconducted at the Feinstein Institute of Medical Research:\n\na. The study is a retrospective, single center study.\n\nb. The study was not conducted according to a pre-specified protocol, and hence,\ndefinitions of the primary efficacy endpoint and the standard of truth that would\nnormally be specified by a protocol, are not well-defined for the study.\n\nReference ID: 3394281\n\nNDA 200655\nPage 2\n\nc. The study used each patient’s clinical diagnosis at the time of referral for a\nFluorodopa F 18 PET scan as the standard of truth for measuring the test’s\nperformance characteristics. We do not find such a standard to be clinically\nmeaningful and do not agree with the cited diagnostic performance measurements of\nFluorodopa F 18 as 100% for sensitivity and 100% for specificity.\n\nd. Of the 185 study patients, 158 patients had a pre-imaging clinical diagnosis of\nParkinson’s disease and were responding to Parkinson’s disease medications. For\nthese patients a Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan provides no additional clinically useful\ninformation. Deficiencies concerning the remaining 27 study patients are discussed\nbelow (Study #16).\n\ne. You have provided no documentation that Fluorodopa F 18 PET images have been\nread independently by three readers blinded to clinical information. Furthermore,\ninspection of the study site revealed that none of the 47 audited cases contained\ndocumentation that each patient’s images were read by three blinded readers.\n\n2. Study #16 is a publication with the follow-up results of 27 Fluorodopa F 18 PET negative\npatients enrolled in Study #15. Study #16 has the following major deficiencies:\n\na. Per your amendment dated April 5, 2013, only 8 of the 27 Fluorodopa F 18 PET\nnegative patients from Study #15 were followed for 2 to 4 years to obtain the\npatient’s final clinical diagnosis. Clinical data from such a small number of patients\ndo not provide a reliable assessment of the performance characteristics of Fluorodopa\nF 18 PET. Furthermore, inspection of the study site revealed that none of the subject\nfiles contained documentation (clinical follow-up confirmation) of the continued\nabsence of classical Parkinson’s Disease symptoms and signs.\n\nb. The reasons for not obtaining follow up on the remaining 19 patients are not\nprovided.\n\n3.

(Study #21) provides clinical data for the assessment of the\nefficacy of Fluorodopa F 18 as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical. However, Study #21 does\nnot provide substantial evidence of efficacy for the following reasons:\n\na. The study is a small single center study and is exploratory in design.\n\nb. All study patients had a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease at the time of enrollment.\nThe study excluded patients with atypical signs and patients not responding to\nParkinson’s disease medication. Therefore, the study does not evaluate a patient\npopulation that might benefit from a diagnostic imaging test.\n\nc.

The\nsubject files did not contain the physician referral letter in 15 of the 47 files audited. The\nfiles typically lacked documentation of the presence of the cardinal features of\nParkinsonian syndrome and/or responsiveness to Parkinson’s disease drugs.\n\nThe case records for the control subjects did not include evidence of an adequate\nneurological examination by a qualified neurologist.\n\nFor all the subjects audited, the case records lacked evidence of PET scan interpretation\nby three separate blinded readers.\n\nStudy treatment and procedures were not adequately documented. For example, there\nwas no documentation of carbidopa administration prior to Fluorodopa F 18 in a total of\n18 of the subject files audited and the use of concomitant medication was inconsistently\ndocumented.\n\nFor Study #16, none of the subject files contained documentation (clinical follow-up\nconfirmation) of continued absence of classical Parkinson’s disease symptoms and signs.\n\nFor Study #15, the available study records indicated that the PET scan procedure was\ndiscontinued in one subject due to an undocumented adverse event.

Blanks, MS, RAC\nChief Regulatory and Quality Officer\n34175 Ardenwood Blvd.\n\nFremont, CA 94555\n\nDear Mr. Blanks:\n\nPlease refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated June 26, 2020, received June\n29, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food,\nDrug, and Cosmetic Act for tenapanor hydrochloride 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg tablets.\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated April 28, 2021, which\nextended the goal date by three months.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined\nthat we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nthese issues.\n\nCLINICAL\n\nTo support efficacy as monotherapy for reducing serum phosphorus in patients with\nchronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, you submitted the results of two randomized,\nmulti-center trials (TEN-02-201 and TEN-02-301). You also submitted the results of a\nthird trial — a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (TEN-02-202), to\nsupport use in combination with existing phosphate binder treatment. All three studies\nevaluated tenapanor’s efficacy in reducing serum phosphorus levels.\n\nIn epidemiologic studies, elevated serum phosphorus levels have been associated with\nan increased risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism, vascular, valvular, and other soft\ntissue calcification and cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD. In patients on\ndialysis, higher serum phosphorus levels have also been associated with increased\nmortality. To date, however, there are no data from outcome studies demonstrating that\na treatment’s effect on serum phosphorus levels predicts its effect on clinical outcomes\nsuch as cardiovascular events or mortality. Nevertheless, the Division of Cardiology and\nNephology, following the precedent set by the former Division of Metabolism and\nEndocrinology Products, treats serum phosphorus reduction as a valid surrogate in\npatients with CKD on dialysis. All currently marketed products for the control of serum\n\nReference ID: 4833092\n\nNDA 213931\nPage 2\n\nphosphorus in patients with CKD on dialysis were approved based on effects on serum\nphosphorus levels. In the trials conducted to support approval, these therapies lowered\nserum phosphorus levels by ~1.5 — 2.2 mg/dL.\n\nIn both monotherapy trials, tenapanor’s efficacy in reducing serum phosphorus levels\nwas assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal period. In\nStudy TEN-02-201, which compared different dosing strategies, an 8-week double-blind\nrandomized treatment period preceded the randomized withdrawal phase; in Study\nTEN-02-301, which included an active comparator, a 26-week open-label, randomized\ntreatment period preceded this phase. In both studies, the primary efficacy analysis\nduring the randomized withdrawal period was to be based on the Efficacy Analysis Set,\na subset of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which was intended to enrich for a\nresponder population. Specifically, the Efficacy Analysis Set limited the primary efficacy\nanalysis to patients who achieved a reduction of 2 1.2 mg/dL in serum phosphorus level\nin the treatment period prior to randomized withdrawal.\n\nAmong the patients randomized to tenapanor in the 26-week open-label treatment\nperiod of Study TEN-02-301, approximately 60% finished the 26-week treatment period\nand were re-randomized to receive tenapanor or placebo during the 12-week\nrandomized withdrawal phase. Of the 219 patients who were randomized into the 8-\nweek treatment period of Study TEN-02-201, approximately 75% completed the 8-week\ntreatment period and entered the 4-week randomized withdrawal phase. Of those who\nentered the randomized withdrawal period, approximately half were excluded from the\nEfficacy Analysis Set used for the primary analysis in Studie\n---\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nGenerate ONLY a single JSON array containing objects for each finding.\n[\n    {\n        \"finding_id\": \"unique_id_for_this_finding\",\n        \"violation_text\": \"The precise sentence(s) describing the specific flaw.\",\n        \"Pillar_Category\": \"One of the four categories listed above.\",\n        \"CFR_Section_Cited\": \"The specific CFR section if mentioned (e.g., 312.60).\",\n        \"Statistical_Consequence\": \"Describe the statistical impact (e.g., Loss of Power, Selection Bias, Data Unreliability).\"\n    },\n    ...\n]\n"

In Study TEN-02-301, the point estimate of the treatment\ndifference in the LS mean change in serum phosphorus from baseline to the end of the\n12-week randomized withdrawal period was 1.37 mg/dL based on the Efficacy Analysis\nSet. However, the clinical relevance of this estimand is unclear given that it was derived\nfrom a subset of the trial population. Analyses based on the ITT population of the\nrandomized withdrawal periods in Study TEN-02-201 and Study TEN-02-301 provide\nperhaps the best estimate of the average treatment effect in the subset of patients who\nare likely to tolerate tenapanor and remain on therapy. The sizes of the treatment\neffects in this subset were small— 0.72 mg/dL and 0.66 mg/dL, respectively.\n\nWe further note that subgroup analyses and analyses of the distribution of the\nresponses did not suggest a “responder” population with a substantially larger response\nto treatment. In exploratory analyses of the 26-week active controlled treatment period\nof Study TEN-02-301, tenapanor’s effect size appeared to be larger in patients with\nmore marked elevations at baseline; however, the effect size still appeared to be\nsmaller than that observed with the active control, and, absent a placebo control, the\nresults of these analyses are challenging to interpret.

In some diseases, we\nhave data from interventional trials that can be used to understand the quantitative\nrelationship between treatment-induced changes in a surrogate and changes in Clinical\noutcomes. In this disease state, we do not have such data.

We note that, in principle, it may be\n\npossible to individualize treatment based on a patient's early response to a drug that\nlowers serum phosphorus levels (i.e., assess for a response at some early time point\nand only continue treatment in patients who have a clinically relevant response);\nhowever, such a strategy would need to be prospectively tested and would also likely\nneed to be based on multiple measurements of serum phosphorus over time to\ndistinguish the treatment effect from intrasubject variability.\n\nPRESCRIBING INFORMATION\n\nWe reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise\nadequate.

Anderson, MS\n\nDirector, Biosimilars Global Regulatory Affairs\n0646 Science Center Drive\n\nSan Diego, CA 92121\n\nDear Mr. Anderson:\n\nPlease refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated June 22, 2017, received\nJune 22, 2017, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for Trazimera\n(PF-05280014).\n\nWe also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated March 26, 2018, April 10, 2018, and\nApril 17, 2018, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable\nsections of the amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies\ncited in this letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve\nthis application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and,\nwhere possible, our recommendations to address these issues.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\n1. Reference is made to the information and data provided to the Agency concerning the\nstability of the PF-05280014 Working Cell Bank (WCB) on January 22, 2018 and\nFebruary 9, 2018. Although the likely root causes for the instability have been identified and\ncorrective actions were implemented in late 2017, the information and data do not support\nthe suitability of the current WCB for commercial production.\n\nReference is also made to your response received on February 21, 2018 to Question | of the\nAgency’s Information Request (IR) dated February 13, 2018 concerning the PF-05280014\nMaster Cell Bank (MCB). Because the MCB has undergone extensive transfers since its\ninception, the information and data provided by the February 21, 2018 response are\ninsufficient to account for the potential impact on MCB stability from these transfers.\n\nTo support a well-controlled and consistent commercial production of PF-05280014, you will\nneed to provide adequate data and information to confirm the stability of the MCB. Once the\n\nReference ID: 4251743\n\nBLA 761081\nPage 2\n\nstability of the MCB is confirmed, you should qualify a new WCB or validate use of the\nMCB for commercial production.\n\n2. References are made to your response received on September 22, 2017 to Comment | of the\nAgency’s IR dated September 1, 2017, and your response received on February 16, 2018 to\nComment la of the Agency’s IR dated February 9, 2018. The Agency does not agree that the\ndata from the Extractable Content experiment support that the lower limit of the fill weight\nrange used during drug product (DP) manufacturing will result in vials filled with sufficient\nDP to consistently meet the label claim of 420 mg. The recovery data in the calculations\nused to support the filling range is based on the average recovery of @™%, and not the\nworst-case recovery of ™ Based on the calculations, a DP vial filled\nat the lower limit of the fill weight range of © recovery would be (Gy\nwhich would not meet the label claim of 420 mg. Tighten the lower fill weight rejection\nlimit and provide data to support that DP vials filled at the lower fill weight limit can\nconsistently deliver 420 mg of PF-05280014.\n\n3. The information and data provided to support the commercial DP shipping validation do not\nprovide sufficient assurance that the quality of the DP is maintained during commercial\nshipping and distribution. We have the following comments:\n\na. The mechanical performance studies, which include an independent evaluation of\nvibration and physical shock, are not sufficiently representative of potential stresses\ninduced during routine distribution conditions, where additional factors may\ncontribute stress (e.g., temperature and pressure changes) and multiple stresses could\noccur concurrently. Therefore, these studies cannot on their own be used in lieu of\nperforming real-time DP shipping validation studies.

The data\nshould include an assessment of product quality of pre- and post-shipping DP\nsamples. Include a detailed description of how the study was performed and if\nperformed using simulated studies, provide a justification for how the simulated\nstudies are sufficiently representative of the commercial shipping conditions.\n\nb. It is not appropriate to leverage stability data to support the allowable shipping\ntemperature range of ™ because DP is subjected to additional stresses during\nshipping, which could potentially impact product stability. To support shipment\noutside of the validated 2-8°C range, real-time shipping studies or sufficiently\nrepresentative simulated studies, as described above, should be performed to support\nthe allowable shipping temperature range.\n\nc. The ability of the passive pallet shipper to maintain the storage temperature of 2-8°C\nin the actual shipping lanes has not been demonstrated. Provide the shipping\nvalidation summary report of the passive pallet shipper in the actual shipping lanes\nduring winter and summer conditions in the BLA resubmission.\n\n4. Implement the following specifications for the control of PF-05280114:\na. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the potential\nmechanisms of action for trastuzumab. In your response received on\nFebruary 05, 2018 to Comment 6c of the Agency’s IR dated January 17, 2018, a\n\nReference ID: 4251743\n\nBLA 761081\nPage 3\n\ncell-based FcyRIIla reporter gene assay was provided as a surrogate assay to assess\nADCC activity in the reference material qualifications. Implement this test, or\nanother validated assay, with appropriate acceptance criterion to control for ADCC\nactivity for DS and DP release and stability. The acceptance criteria should be based\non product understanding, current process understanding, and clinical experience.\n\nb. As noted in the Agency’s IR on November 7, 2017, isomerization of Asp102 (iso\nAsp102) is shown to impact the potency of trastuzumab. The iso Asp102 is enriched\nin the BO peak in CEX-HPLC and the BO peak of PF-05280114 increases under mild\nthermal stressed conditions (Section 3.2.8.3.1); therefore, a control strategy for iso\nAsp102 should be in place to ensure product safety, quality and potency. Given that\nyour current potency assay is not sensitive enough to detect changes in iso Asp102\nand it is not appropriate to control iso Asp102 using CEX-HPLC (Refer to IR dated\nJanuary 4, 2018), an assay should be developed and implemented to control for the\nlevel of iso Asp102 for DS and DP release and stability, with appropriate acceptance\ncriterion.\n\nc. As part of the Agency’s current considerations regarding the control of effector\nfunction, it is understood from publicly available literature that high mannose species\ncontribute to the total level of afucosylated variants. Given the impact of\nafucosylated variants on potency, we recommend that the total level of high mannose\nbe included as part of the control strategy for the PF-08250114 DS. Implement an\nappropriate control for high mannose into the DS release specification. The\nacceptance criteria should be based on the current process understanding and clinical\nexperience.\n\nd. Polysorbate 20 is a critical excipient that can impact product quality and stability.\nAdd testing and quantitative acceptance criteria for Polysorbate 20 to the\nPF-05280014 DP release specification.\n\ne. Add the test of “extractable content” to the DP release specification with the\nacceptance criterion of “No less than 420 mg” to ensure that DP lots will meet the\nlabel claim.\n\n5.

Selectivity data from the experiments conducted in normal human serum during\nthe validation of the bioanalytical method to quantitate concentrations of\nBAT1706 and EU-Avastin did not meet the acceptance criteria, which may\nsuggest the presence of interference that may impact the ability to accurately\nmeasure the BAT1706 and EU-Avastin concentrations. Therefore, the PK data\nfrom Study BAT1706-001-CR could not be used to support a demonstration of\nbiosimilarity or establish the PK component of the scientific bridge to support the\nrelevance of data generated using EU-Avastin as the comparator product in\nstudy BAT1706-003-CR. As a result, there is insufficient PK data to conclude that\nBAT1706 has no clinically meaningful differences from US-Avastin in terms of\nsafety, purity, and potency.\n\nTo address this deficiency, repeat experiments at the lower limit of quantitation\n\n(LLOQ) and high quality control (HQC) to establish the selectivity of the\nbioanalytical method for BAT1706 and EU-Avastin.\n\nReference ID: 4890571\n\nBLA 761198\nPage 2\n\nMICROBIOLOGY\n\n2.\n\nPRODUCT QUALITY\n\nDrug Substance (DS) and DP Manufacturing and Control Strategy\n\n5.\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 4890571 eee ee |\n\n\nBLA 761198\nPage 5\n\n(b) (4)\n\nPRESCRIBING INFORMATION\n\n7.

The results of the HF validation study demonstrated several use errors\nand close calls with critical tasks that may result in harm to the patient.\nSpecifically, results from your HF validation study demonstrated that several\nparticipants used the product inappropriately resulting in use errors (e.g., failure\nto wipe nozzle tip, administration of a second pump actuation in the same nostril,\nadministration of a single pump actuation in both nostrils). These use errors led\nto administration of higher than intended doses of drug substance.\n\nAs conveyed in he Discipline Review letter, we note that the\nmajority of available nasal products delivered through pump actuation have an\nassociated mental model of a single dose consisting of administration of drug\n\nsubstance into both nostrils. Conversely, scopolamine nasal gel is intended to be\nadministered as a single dose consisting of one pump actuation of drug\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration\nSilver Spring, MD 20993\nwww.fda.gov\n\nReference ID: 5316661\n\nNDA 214315\nPage 4\n\nsubstance into a single nostril.\nInformation needed to resolve the deficiencies:\n\nImplement user interface revisions and design modifications to promote the safe and\neffective use of the proposed product, and provide data demonstrating that, with these\nmitigations, the product user interface can be used safely and effectively to deliver the\nintended dose of drug substance.\n\nAs the established mental model may limit the impact of measures to mitigate the\nidentified medication errors (e.g., administration of a dose higher than intended), we\nrecommend you consider the potential for a dose of your product to be provided within\nthe existing mental model (i.e., for a dose of product to be delivered as 0.08 mg of\nscopolamine nasal gel per a single pump actuation in each nostril, to provide a total\ndose of 0.16 mg of scopolamine nasal gel over 2 actuations of the device).\n\nPrior to conducting an assessment to evaluate the impact of any mitigation strategies\n(e.g., modifications proposed during the oe teleconference including\nchanges to the principal display panel of the carton, modifications to the device label,\ninclusion of a Quick Start guide), we recommend submitting your HF validation study\nprotocol, along with the redesigned user interface, for our review and feedback.\n\nPRESCRIBING INFORMATION\n\nWe reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise\nadequate.

As such, you may want to consider\nincorporating product that is freshly manufactured (<6 months in age) and product\nthat is nearing the end of shelf-life (>12 months in age) in your trial if the\nreformulated product is not expected to exhibit greater stability than the current\nformulation.\n\n3.

These differences could have an impact on™\n\nand\ncould result in the variation in delivery of the active ingredient to the patients.\n\nFurther, the in vitro bridging data in the submission is inadequate to justify the above\nchanges for the following reasons: (1) With respect to the in vitro release method, a\ndifferent method at batch release was used for the batch in Study P-15086 from that\nfor the registration batches; (2) The study and testing regarding donepezil base\ncontent was not conducted at batch release for the registration batches, nor for the\nbatch used in Study P-15086; (3) The submitted document in P.2.3 Appendix 1,\nBioequivalence (BE) and Registration Product Comparison, compared batches with\ndifferent manufacturing processes, active product ingredient particle sizes, storage\ntimes, and storage temperatures in addition to scale changes.

Question 6b from our December 31, 2019, Information Request: Provide a\ncomparison of the donepezil free base and donepezil HCI content in the\nclinical drug product batches to the registration drug product batches.\n\nc. Question 3 from our March 9, 2020, Information Request: Results from the\nICH Q1B photostability study indicates that the unpouched drug product is\nimpacted by exposure to light. Perform an in-use stability study to\ndemonstrate that the drug product quality remains unaffected through the\nlongest expected period of use (7 days) at lowest dose (5 mg/day). Ensure\nthat the drug product is exposed to light (e.g., 10 hours a day) each of the\nseven days to mimic a worst-case scenario.\n\n11. We are concerned with the proposed oral-to-transdermal system switch strategy\nfor the 5 mg/day treatment. For the 5 mg/day treatment, donepezil concentrations\nduring the first 10 days after oral-to-transdermal system switch were observed to\nbe lower than the oral Cmin,ss Of 20.6 ng/mL. The clinical relevance of these lower\nconcentrations is not known, and to ensure clinical benefit, oral supplementation\nwith 5 mg/day ARICEPT may be required during the first 2 weeks of oral-to-\ntransdermal system switch. Additional simulations must be conducted to derive\nan appropriate oral-to-transdermal system switch for 5 mg/day treatment.\n\n12. Due to the issue stated above related to ease of separation of the laminate\nlayers, we have serious safety concerns that could arise if layer separation\noccurs during the use of the ADLARITY transdermal system.

You may incorporate applicable\nsections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the\ndeficiencies cited in this letter.\n\nWe have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined\nhat we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our\nreasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address\nhese issues.\n\nNONCLINICAL\n\nYou have not provided adequate toxicological risk assessments for leachables over the\n5 mcg/day qualification threshold. We acknowledge your original approach in utilizing a\n‘oxicological threshold of concern of 120 mcg/day as recommended in ICH M7.\nHowever, this approach only addresses the genotoxicity aspects of a compound and is\nnot acceptable to address the general toxicity of any given leachable compound. In\naddition, we acknowledge receipt of the June 21, 2022 submission containing a\noxicological risk assessment for tentatively identified compounds detected above the\nanalytical evaluation threshold; however, this submission was not formally reviewed\nbecause, as noted in your cover letter of the submission, the compounds have only\nbeen tentatively identified to date and method validation is still ongoing. Our\nassessment of the safety of leachables to support a marketing application should be\nbased on confirmed compounds quantified using validated methods.\n\nReference ID: 5007085\n\nNDA 215320\nPage 2\n\nInformation needed to address the deficiency\n\nSubmit a revised toxicological risk assessment for all leachable compounds detected\nabove the 5 mcg/day threshold. Submit documentation that the structural identification\nof the compounds has been confirmed and quantification has been completed using\nvalidated methods. The risk assessment should be based on the maximum level of\neach leachable expected to be present in the drug product based upon the analysis of\nthe data from your long-term stability samples. The approach for toxicological evaluation\nof the safety of leachables should be based on good scientific principles. Include copies\nof all referenced studies upon which a safety assessment is based. In addition, consider\nthe following points as you prepare your toxicological risk assessments:\n\na. If you employ a Permissible Daily Exposure (PDE) assessment as described in\nICH Q3C, provide justification for all safety factors employed.\n\nb. Published literature submitted to support the safety of any compound rarely\nprovides adequate detail of the study design and study results to permit a\nthorough independent evaluation of the data. Summary reviews, [e.g., BIBRA\nToxicology Advice & Consulting (BIBRA), Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR),\nHuman and Environmental Risk Assessment on ingredients of household\ncleaning products (HERA)], although potentially useful to identify original source\nmaterial, are not acceptable as the source material is not provided and the\nconclusions cannot be independently verified. Submission of any published study\nreports should be accompanied by a detailed comparison to modern toxicology\nstudy endpoints and any shortcomings of the study should be discussed and\njustification should be provided to support your assertion that these data are\nadequate to support the safety of your container closure system.\n\nc.
