scPharmaceuticals, Inc.

Attention: Sanjay Sehgal, PhD

Senior Vice President

Regulatory Affairs, QA & Compliance
2400 District Ave, Suite 310
Burlington, MA 01803

Dear Dr. Sehgal:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received August 23, 2017, and your
amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act for Furoscix™ Furosemide), 80 mg/10 mL, Drug-device combination product.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve
this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and,
where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CDRH/DEVICE

1. As part of the device description, we were unable to locate the following alarms
consistent with the FDA Guidance, Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle within your
submission for the Furoscix Infusor:
¢ Occlusion detection alarm
e Low or empty reservoir alarm
e Undocking alarm
e Key pressed alarm
e Tone test failure alarm

The Agency believes these alarms are critical to the safe operation of the device. Make
appropriate changes to the device, provide a justification for why these alarms are not
necessary, or provide alternative mitigations.

2. Inthe study, CP-00001 Product Design Clinical Validation, you defined the volume
accuracy endpoint as “Delivery 80mg +10% = minimal 9mL dispensed from device.”
This is inconsistent with the device specifications which state dose accuracy as volume to
be delivered: © Therefore, according to the device
specifications the delivery volume should be between! mL. It is unclear how dose

Reference ID: 4275803

NDA 209988

Page 2

Reference ID: 4275803

accuracy was measured in this pivotal study. Since dose accuracy is a critical endpoint
this discrepancy needs to be resolved. Please describe how you measured dose accuracy
in the study and how the study validates the design specifications for the device.

. According to the results from the CP-00001, Product Design Clinical Validation study

you did not meet the predefined endpoints. Please address how the improvements since
the study was completed result in a device that can meet the pre-defined endpoints for
this particular study and provide evidence to validate that these changes are likely to
address the errors or provide a new clinical validation study. (Please see the Clinical
comments for additional information regarding study CP-00001).

You provided several documents outlining the Risk Management process for the Furoscix
Infusor in Sequence 0001/3.2R. The risk assessment criteria and risk acceptability as
outlined in RA-0002, scPharmaceuticals Risk Management Plan, Appendix I, defines the
severity, occurrence and detection ratings in accordance with ISO 14971. Additionally,
you have defined the risk threshold for the intended use of the Furoscix Infusor on p.7-8

as: (b) (4)

The resulting risk and hazard analyses do not follow the definitions as defined in RA-
0002.pdf. From a high-level perspective, the Agency disagrees with the severity ratings
assigned in the Use Error Analysis (DD-0001.pdf), scPharmaceuticals Risk Management
Report (RA-0023.pdf), seCFAS Risk Analysis Report (RA-0010.pdf) and
scPharmaceuticals Hazard Analysis (RA-0007.pdf) to the hazards of underdosing,
infection and over-diuresis for the following reasons:

a. Hazard — Underdosing: Device failures resulting in underdosing, especially
undetected, can lead to decompensation in patients with congestive heart failure
which requires medical intervention or hospitalization. Revise your risk analysis
document to make all hazards with harm of underdosing, a severity of 4.

b. Hazard — Infection: Harm causing local or systemic infection in patients with
congestive heart failure requires medical intervention. Revise your risk analysis
document to make all hazards with harm of infection, a severity of 4.

c. Hazard — Over-Diuresis: Over-Diuresis in patients with congestive heart failure
can lead to electrolyte imbalances which require hospitalization to stabilize.
Revise your risk analysis document to make all hazards with harm of over-
diuresis a severity of 4.

You will need to update your risk management documentation to reflect these new
severity ratings and then recalculate the Risk Level (Risk Analysis and FMEA) and Risk
Priority Numbers (Process FMEA and Design FMEA). Based on the revised risk


NDA 209988
Page 3

analysis you will need to update your design verification/validation documents, Human
Factors documentation (See Human Factors section, request for updated use-related risk
analysis) and Risk Analysis documents (including the Safety Assurance case) to reflect

the new evaluation of the risk for each hazard. You should use these new evaluations to
drive the mitigation measures as appropriate for each hazard.

Revise your risk documentation to reflect the new severity ratings including any new
mitigations that are resulting from the higher risk categorization. Provide evidence to
support the new mitigations including any additional testing to support design or labeling
changes.

5. When revisiting the risk analysis, the Agency has the following comments that need to be
addressed for specific aspects of the submission including the risk management, design
verification/validation and human factors sections (See Human Factors section, request
for updated use-related risk analysis).

You will need
to update you risk documentation to use consistent definitions of limited,
moderate, severe and catastrophic health hazards.

b. You have provided multiple severity ratings for individual hazards. Each hazard
should have a single severity rating. You will need to revise the risk
documentation to be consistent in defining the severity rating for each hazard.

c. Inthe Use Error Analysis (which we refer to as the use-related risk analysis), we
note a discrepancy, please refer to Human Factors section, request for updated
use-related risk analysis.

6. In your safety assurance case, you have not provided evidence to support the following
claims:
°

Reference ID: 4275803

NDA 209988
Page 4

(b) (4)

Without evidence to support the claims, the safety assurance case is incomplete and does
not support the top level goal of safety. Therefore you will need to provide arguments
supported by evidence for all claims in the safety assurance case.

7. In your safety assurance case under the risk mitigations for under-dosing (S#10375) you
have not considered any use errors or environmental factors which may contribute to an
under-dosing event. Therefore, the safety assurance case is not complete. You will need
to update your assurance case and any supporting evidence to consider environmental
factors and user errors which might contribute to under dosing.

8. Because of the deficient reports, the evidence does not support that acceptable
mitigations have been implemented and verified to support the top-level goal of safety.
Therefore, the deficient reports will need to be resolved before the safety assurance case
can be deemed complete and acceptable.

9. You provided several reports to support the verification and validation of the
performance criteria of your device. However, the Agency identified several deficiencies
in the reports. You will need to resolve the following deficiencies associated with the
reports:

a. Report-0154 — Lay

i. All test reports should have clearly stated objectives, acceptance criteria, methods,
results (including raw data) and a conclusion that states how the results met the

user requirement. Report-0154 does not contain this information and it is not clear

which requirements are being supported by this report. For that reason, the report

is deficient. Provide a test report © that
provides all the required elements to support design verification.
ii. Report-0154, © was performed with an earlier version

of the software. Provide a justification for why the updates to the software since
the testing do not impact the results of the verification testing or repeat the testing
with the current version of the software.

i. Reports -0167, -0170, -0172, -0173 and -0186 are audits of the actual
verification tests. While you state the tests were conducted and passed, you do
not provide the specific test methods, specifications, or results. Therefore, the
Agency cannot determine whether the reports support the user requirements.
Provide a test report that contains the objective, acceptance criteria, methods,
results (including raw data) and a conclusion that states how each test satisfies
the user requirements.

c. Report-0178 — UL Test Report (IEC 60601-1) Medical electrical equipment

i. It is unclear what system-level performance verification was performed to verify
the system-level performance requirements at the intended environmental
conditions and at reasonable challenged environmental conditions. It is unclear
how this report supports the user requirements. Provide a test report that
explicitly states the objective, acceptance criteria, methods, results (including
raw data) and a conclusion that states how the test satisfies the user requirements.

d. Report-0185 —

i. In Report-0185, © ""did not provide the
scope/objective or methods. It is not clear which requirements are being
supported by this report. Provide a test report that contains the objective,
acceptance criteria, methods, results (including raw data) and a conclusion that

ii. This testing was performed with an earlier version of the software. Provide a
justification for why the updates to the software since the testing do not impact
the results of the verification testing or repeat the testing with the current version
of the software.

iii. Per the sample size requirements in Report-0185 more than 30 samples are
needed to establish a 95/95 confidence interval for the acceptance criteria.
Provide a justification for why only 30 samples were used or repeat the testing
with a sample size large enough to establish a 95/95 confidence interval as

lescribed in the acceptance criteria.

Provide an SDS specification document and revise your trace document to trace

the SRS requirements to their SDS documents.

b. For any SRS that defines internal checking performed by your software outside of
the POST testing, include the frequency at which this testing is performed. This
frequency is not defined in your SRS requirements. This should include how
often device status messages are relayed to the module that monitors it (i.e.
battery level checking, etc.).

c. The following SRS requirements define errors but you did not define how they

are triggered (voltage values, etc.). In the SRS requirement provide how the error

(Electronic Design Description) but this document does not appear to have been
provided. It is preferred if you provide these values directly in the SRS
requirement.

d. It is not clear what software modules are included in some of your POST testing.
Describe where in the software architecture, the error code mechanisms in SRSs:

software units these mechanisms do not test and justify why they do not.

e. It is not clear from your requirements how the pump checks to determine if its
system time is correct and is not affected by a software defect or data corruption.
Since your five-hour delivery profile has two phases, a defect to the system time
can affect the length of each phase thus causing potential over- or under-delivery.
Provide the SRS and SDS specifications that describe how your pump ensures the
integrity of its time data and if there are any errors that triggered if this
information is corrupted. If you do not have an error code for this situation,
devise and provide the SRS, SDS, risk and verification documentation.

f. There are no requirements for the maximum load (data usage and error messages)
the memory can handle or how the system may purge information so this
maximum load is not met. Correct this deficiency by 1) explaining how the data
generated from 100 use cycles cannot affect the memory of the system or 2)
providing the SRS requirements defining maximum load and/or purge, and the
verification testing, and stress testing to verify these requirements.

The FDA guidance document, Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for
Software Contained in Medical Devices, issued on May 11, 2005, recommends a SDS
document be provided for software with a Major Level of Concern, and the traceability
document to trace the SRS to the SDS.

If this is a software defect, then you need to correct this issue before releasing to the
market because you cannot predict software defect occurrence rates regardless of how
much testing you perform. IEC 62304 recommends performing software risk analysis
based on severity alone because if there is a defect it will always present when you
understand the actual user actions that causes the defect. Answer our questions above to
determine if it is a software defect © If it is a software defect, correct it
and provide the verification to show it was adequately corrected and the correction did
not inadvertently affect your device.

The FDA guidance document, Guidance for the Content of Premarket Submissions for

CLINICAL

25. The Furoscix Infusor Product Design Clinical Validation Study (PDCV), Study CP-00001
did not meet its primary endpoint, “Absence of Major Product Failure.” Success for this
endpoint was based on a success rate for “freedom from major system related failures leading
to under-infusion.” The trial was to be deemed successful if the lower limit of the 95%
confidence interval of the success rate was >95%. Even when the 7 patients who did not
complete the 5-hour infusion period are excluded, the success rate was 63 of 67, or 94%.

Of the 4 device failures among the 67 completers, 3 were dispensing failures related to
inadequate preparation of the device coupled with a device design flaw. In each of these

26. In CP-00001, the devices were prepared, attached to the patient and then removed at the end
of the 5-hour treatment period by trained study staff. We think it is likely that if patients or
lay caregivers had been given responsibility for these tasks in CP-00001, the failure rate in
the study might have been higher than it was. Thus, the results from study CP-00001 may
overstate the reliability of the studied device. However, we believe that if this product is
approved, it will not be uncommon for patients or lay caregivers to set up, attach, and remove
the device. Accordingly, if you conduct another study to validate the performance of a re-
engineered version of your device, you should require only suitably trained patients or lay
care-givers to set up, attach, and remove the device. If the training is performed using a video
presentation, the video should be a component of the proposed labeling. The study should
include persons with a range of educational backgrounds.

HUMAN FACTORS

27. The human factors (HF) data do not support a conclusion that your proposed product can be
used safely and effectively by the intended users for its intended uses and use environments.
You have not adequately addressed all the use errors from your validation studies that could
lead to patient harm due to delay in treatment, partial treatment, or treatment omission. We
acknowledge that you did not consider these use errors to be critical to the safe and effective
use of the proposed product because the product is not intended for use in emergency
situations. You state that |

© would not cause serious harm to the patient Coy

(b) (4)

©"" However, we disagree because delayed, partial, or omitted treatment may require
medical intervention and potential hospitalization.

28. We acknowledge that you made modifications to the product design and instructional
materials to address some of the errors after studies 123 and 133. While the iterative changes
are aligned with the principles of HF engineering, it does not appear that final user interface
was validated in the intended user populations. Furthermore, despite the mitigations,
participants still experienced errors and difficulty using the product, suggesting the
mitigations were not effective.

To address this deficiency, the Agency requests that you conduct adequate root cause
analyses for all use errors that could lead to harm (including compromised or delayed
care), implement adequate risk mitigation measures, update your use-related risk
analysis, and test the effectiveness of your mitigations in a new HF validation study with
at least 15 representative users in each distinct user group. We recommend that you
submit your updated use-related risk analysis and human factors validation study protocol
for review prior to commencing the study.

Reference ID: 4275803

NDA 209988
Page 14

29. We recommend you consider the following as you update your use-related risk analysis and
design your HF protocol methodology:

a) Use errors that can cause potential serious harm (including compromised medical
treatment, contamination, and infection) should be evaluated as critical tasks!.

b) Hazards that can cause potential damage to the device (i.e., disengaging the device by
force) may not be detected and may result in delay of treatment or treatment omission
with subsequent treatments. Implement additional mitigation strategies to
communicate hazardous situations to the users, and ensure your use-related risk
analysis and HF protocol evaluate such hazards and associated mitigations
accordingly.

c) Ensure the training methodology employed in your future HF testing (including
trainers, training materials, and training decay periods) reflect the training that
intended users would receive in real-world, and include justification for the training
methodology.

d) We expect your HF study report to document subjective feedback collected from
study participants for all use errors, difficulties, and close calls (including
participant’s feedback on potential root cause of the use errors, difficulties, and close
calls).

e) We expect your HF study to test the final intend-to-market user interface or provide

justification for not testing alterations. Alterations to the device in your HF studies

may have
limited testing of the full functionality of the device and effectiveness of the user
interface in the simulated studies Oo and

confounds the interpretation of the study results. Furthermore, because you made
changes to the instructional materials after HF studies 123 and 133, you may not have
adequately validated your final user interface (final instructional material) in the
intended user populations.

f) We expect your HF study to evaluate user ability to understand all warnings, alerts,
and troubleshooting the device. We consider user’s understanding of critical
warnings, alerts, and ability to troubleshoot the device to be critical tasks and should
be evaluated in HF validation testing.

30. Our review of the proposed product’s labels, labeling and video identified areas that should
be modified. We recommend you implement the following prior to conducting another HF

Attention: Debleena Sengupta, PhD, RAC
Senior Director, Regulatory Affairs

245 First Street, Suite 1400

Cambridge, MA 02142

Dear Dr. Sengupta:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 28, 2021, received
March 29, 2021, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for vadadustat tablets.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

CLINICAL AND STATISTICAL

Your submitted data do not support a favorable benefit-risk assessment of vadadustat
for the proposed indication of treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) in adults not on dialysis and on dialysis. Our determination that the
benefits of vadadustat do not outweigh the risks applies to both the non-dialysis-
dependent (NDD) and dialysis-dependent (DD) populations of patients with anemia
associated with CKD.

With regard to the benefits of vadadustat, you have met the efficacy endpoint of
hemoglobin (Hb) response by demonstrating that the change from baseline in Hb with
vadadustat is non-inferior to that of darbepoetin alfa, an erythropoietin stimulating agent
(ESA), in both the NDD and DD populations of patients with anemia associated with
CKD. However, there was higher use of rescue therapy for worsening anemia with
vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa, particularly for ESA rescue in the NDD-CKD
population and for ESA and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion rescue in the DD-CKD
population. Some of these differences in rescue therapy are striking. For example, in
DD-CKD Trial 0016, ESA rescue for worsening anemia was reported in 22% of
vadadustat-treated patients compared to 5% of darbepoetin alfa-treated patients. The
corresponding rates in DD-CKD Trial 0017 were 35% and 14%. In addition, in the DD-
CKD trials there was a higher incidence of RBC transfusion rescue therapy for
worsening anemia with vadadustat, which could potentially impact alloreactivity, a risk
factor for renal allograft rejection in patients who undergo kidney transplantation.

Reference ID: 4960457

NDA 215192
Page 2

As an oral therapy, vadadustat may offer convenience compared to the intravenous
route of ESAs, especially in the NDD-CKD population and the minority of dialysis
patients who receive peritoneal dialysis. However, the convenience of an oral drug in
the DD-CKD population is less clear for most DD-CKD patients in the United States
(U.S.), who receive hemodialysis and are administered ESA at the time of hemodialysis.

The trials established no other benefits of vadadustat in the NDD-CKD or DD-CKD
populations.

We have identified the following major safety concerns with vadadustat that outweigh
these benefits:

1.

In the NDD-CKD population primary analysis, you did not establish non-inferiority
for vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa on the primary safety endpoint of
adjudicated major adverse cardiac events (MACE) — a composite of all-cause
mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and non-fatal stroke — with a hazard
ratio (HR) of 1.17 (95% confidence interval 1.01, 1.36). The upper bound of this
95% confidence interval excluded the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1.25.
Furthermore, the lower bound excluded the value of no effect. The risk of MACE
with vadadustat was seen in comparison to darbepoetin alfa, an ESA with an
established increased risk of non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, and all-cause
mortality. In addition, each component of the adjudicated MACE endpoint had a
numerically unfavorable HR for vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa.

Your conclusion that vadadustat is safe in the U.S. population is not supported by
the data. In the U.S. subgroup, the estimated hazard ratio for adjudicated MACE
was 1.06 (95% Cl, 0.87, 1.29); the upper bound of 1.29 does not provide
assurance of an absent safety signal for MACE occurrence in the U.S.
Furthermore, there was an increased hazard ratio for the non-fatal MI component
of MACE in the vadadustat arm in the U.S. population (HR, 1.49, 95% Cl, 0.97,
2.30), comparable to that of the overall population.

In the DD-CKD population, there was a concerning signal for adjudicated
thromboembolic (TE) events with vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa, an
ESA with an established increased risk of TE events. The HR was 1.20 (95% Cl
0.96, 1.50) for the overall population and appeared more concerning in the U.S.
subgroup, which had an estimated HR of adjudicated TE of 1.46 (95% Cl 1.13,
1.89).

Furthermore, over 80% of adjudicated TE events were vascular access
thromboses. The estimated HR for adjudicated vascular access thrombosis
events was 1.28 (95% Cl 1.00, 1.63). This result is particularly concerning in the
DD-CKD population given the critical need for vascular access for these patients.

3. Your submitted data raise concerns for a clinically significant risk for drug-

induced liver injury (DILI) with the use of vadadustat in patients with CKD. This
conclusion is based on one Hy’s Law case, at least seven cases of probable
drug-induced liver injury (DILI) with significant elevation in alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) without jaundice, and an imbalance in ALT elevations
with vadadustat compared to darbepoetin alfa (e.g., ALT >3x ULN in 0.47% of
patients treated with vadadustat compared to 0.35% of patients treated with
darbepoetin alfa; ALT >5x ULN in 0.31% of patients treated with vadadustat vs.
0.25% of patients treated with darbepoetin alfa). The elevation in alkaline
phosphatase in the Hy’s Law case does not preclude a conclusion of
hepatocellular DILI. Using the new R-value (nR value) criterion, this subject had
hepatocellular DILI with at least 10% mortality risk, fulfilling Hy’s Law.

Furthermore, we have concerns that the risks seen in the clinical trials where patients
were closely monitored (e.g., with liver tests), may underestimate the risks with real-
world use of vadadustat, if approved. Given that ESAs are typically administered by
health care providers, hemoglobin and patient monitoring is fairly well assured. With the
convenience of an orally administered drug such as vadadustat, there is the potential for
inadequate patient monitoring (e.g., hemoglobin, liver tests) that could lead to worse
outcomes in some settings as well as the potential to prescribe vadadustat to patients
with anemia and decreased creatinine clearance who presently do not receive ESAs.
Some of these patients, particularly the elderly, would be at greater risk of MACE. We
could not identify a risk mitigation strategy that can adequately mitigate the risks of
vadadustat with the proposed dosing regimen to ensure that the benefits of vadadustat
outweigh its risks.

Potential Path Forward:

1.

Conduct new clinical trial(s) that establish a favorable benefit/risk assessment of
vadadustat in a specific patient population or with a different dosing regimen. In
your new clinical trial(s) also assess the following:

e The occurrence of ESA and RBC transfusion rescue therapies, as key
secondary efficacy endpoints.

e Rhabdomyolysis as an adverse event of interest, with appropriate clinical and
laboratory assessments. We noted numerical imbalances in the incidence of
rhabdomyolysis, a rare event, in your NDD population (10 cases with
vadadustat vs. 4 cases with darbepoetin alfa) and DD population (5 cases
with vadadustat vs. 3 cases with darbepoetin alfa). Vadadustat has a known
drug-drug interaction potential with some statins, but the role of this drug-drug
interaction in the development of rhabdomyolysis is unclear.

e Seizures as an adverse event of interest. The risk of seizure with vadadustat
appears comparable to the known seizure risk associated with ESAs.

2. You will also need to propose and assess a strategy that successfully mitigates
the risk of hepatotoxicity with the use of vadadustat in patients with CKD. Note
that even if you are able to mitigate the risks of MACE and TE in a specific
population or with a different dosing regimen, we have significant concerns
regarding the ability to mitigate the risk of DILI given that this DIL] appears
idiosyncratic, and patients are not as closely monitored in the real-world setting
compared to clinical trials. DILI can cause acute liver failure, the need for liver
transplantation, or death. Even if rare, it is not clear that the convenience of oral
dosing could outweigh such risks.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

e In both the NDD-CKD population and DD-CKD populations there was a
higher risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal
acid-related disease, observed in the vadadustat arm compared to the
darbepoetin alfa arm. We expect these findings to be adequately mitigated
with labeling when vadadustat can be approved, provided there are no
concerning gastrointestinal findings in future clinical trials of vadadustat.

Dear Mr. Palmer:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received January 8, 2021,
and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act for risperidone extended-release injectable suspension.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated September 10, 2021, and
September 23, 2021, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate
applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to
the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

OPHTHALMOLOGY

On August 21, 2021, we sent an information request with several questions about your
ophthalmologic examination data. On September 1, 2021, we received your response to
our questions (eCTD #0032). In your response, you committed to perform a full data re-
check and re-analyses of ophthalmologic findings and submit a response no earlier than
October 15, 2021. Of the six ophthalmologic questions in our August 21, 2021,
information request, you must fully address questions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in (or prior to)
your NDA resubmission.

HUMAN FACTORS
The results of your human factors (HF) validation study indicated the need for further
revisions to your user interface in order to mitigate residual risk.

In particular, we are concerned that your intended users may have difficulty injecting the
full dose of medication due to the viscosity of the product, as evidenced by use
difficulties and use errors in your human factors validation study.

Reference ID: 4861793

We sent an information request on August 20, 2021, for you to provide data or
information (for example, anthropometry or other data) to support that the intended
users will be able to reliably deliver the full dose of medication, and that the injection
rate used in the glide force testing is representative of actual use. We have received a
response to this information request; however, the additional information will not be
reviewed at this time. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the proposed product user
interface supports safe and effective use by the intended users, for the intended use,
and in the intended use environment.

We recommend you provide data or information to support that the intended users will
be able to reliably and effectively deliver the full dose of medication. If you are unable to
provide such data or information, we recommend you redesign the product to ensure
that it supports use by the intended users, for the intended uses, and in the intended
use environments. Any product redesign will require an additional human factors
validation study to demonstrate that the design mitigations were effective.

Additionally, we recommend you take additional measures to ensure that the finger
flange remains in place during injection and does not interfere with the operation of the
syringe.

21, 2021.

b. Perform a thermal cycling study to determine acceptable
temperature/humidity excursions of the powder syringe (risperidone and

the drug product.

Biopharmaceutics
1. The provided in vitro drug release testing (IVRT) data from the clinical and

registration batches show high inter-batch and intra-batch variabilities. The observed
high variabilities could come from inconsistent drug product quality, dissolution
method, analytical method/assay, or other sources. You have not provided adequate
information/data to confirm and address the source(s) of this variability. We
recommend that you investigate and identify the source(s) of the observed variability
and provide data supporting the findings.

2. The proposed wide dissolution acceptance criteria ranges are permissive and
unacceptable. Please note that, in general, the selection of the dissolution
acceptance criteria ranges is based on mean target value + #% and >""% for the
last specification time-point. Wider specification ranges may be acceptable if they
are supported by an established “safe space” based on an approved IVIVC model,
PBBM, etc. For an established safe space, the acceptable dissolution specifications
should ensure bioequivalence/clinical relevance of future batches with dissolution
profiles falling between the identified extreme ranges within the limits.

facilities:

e Rovi Pharma Industrial Services SA (FEI: 3007512884; Spain)

e Rovi Pharma Industrial Services SA (FEI: 3002989591; Spain)

are required before this application can be approved. FDA must assess the ability of
these facilities to conduct the listed manufacturing operations in compliance with
CGMP. Due to restrictions on travel, we were unable to complete inspections during the
current review cycle for your application. You may respond to deficiencies in this
Complete Response Letter while the travel restrictions remain in effect. However, even
if these deficiencies are addressed, the application cannot be approved until the
required FDA inspections are completed and any findings are assessed with regard to
our application. We will continue to monitor the public health situation as well as travel
restrictions. We are actively working to define an approach for scheduling outstanding
inspections once safe travel may resume and based on public health need and other
factors.

Because approval of your application requires inspections that cannot be completed in a
timely manner due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, the FDA has made aan initial
determination that the amendment to your application in response to this complete
response letter will be received as an amendment as described in the 2020 Guidance
for Industry Review Timelines for Applicant Reponses to Complete Response Letters
When a Facility Assessment Is Needed During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.

you also claimed that “The following pesticides are used at the early stages of
growth of the pineapple plants which are used as source of the stems for the

manufacture of BSP: a.
”™ are included in the pesticides test in USP
<561>. “are analyzed separately. In addition to these

pesticides, there is the possibility that other pesticides from surrounding farms
could contaminate the pineapple plants.” It appears that on p.10-13 and p.22 of
the TGAP, 2007 submitted to the FDA, some pesticides and herbicides listed are
not included in the list mentioned above, and are not listed in the USP <561> or
Ph. Eur 2.8.13. Please clarify what pesticides and herbicides are used during the
cultivation of the pineapples and weed control for pineapples used for the
production of BSP. As well, clarify if tests conducted on the BRM will cover all
pesticides and herbicides used.

We acknowledge you provided cultivar composition analysis of BSP batches
manufactured between 2011 and 2019 (3.2.S.2.3.1.1.3.6 of the amendment). For
future manufacturing, we recommend you develop strategies and acceptance
criteria to determine how the cultivars will be pooled to produce individual
batches of BSP and drug product.

52.We acknowledge you provided a “List of farmers provided’ BRM used for

production of BSP used for production of NexoBrid DP batches used in the
phase 3 study MW2010-03-02 (DETECT)” in your amendment. However, batch
records along with batch analysis of BRM used to produce phase 3 batches were
not provided. We recommend you provide batch analysis of BRM following the
originally proposed BRM release specifications (the released specification
submitted in the original BLA). In addition, please clarify whether BRM from the
phase 3 BSP and drug product batches are available. If so, as recommended in
the pre-BLA meeting dated November 19, 2019 and outlined in the IR dated
December 19, 2020, we recommend you analyze the BRM used for phase 3 BSP
and drug product production to establish acceptance criteria for pesticides,
aflatoxins, microbial limits and elemental impurities in the BRM release
specifications.

53. In the 3.2.S.2.3.1.2.3 of the amendment, the description of the list of fertilizers

used was unclear. Please provide the complete list of fertilizers used and clarify
what organic fertilizers were used.

55.In addition to the control of BRM, we recommend you conduct orthogonal
analysis of chemical and biological data produced in BSP and/or drug substance
(if applicable) and final product that were used in phase 3 trials. Subsequently,
correlate the batch analysis to clinical outcomes to assess treatment-by-batch
interactions and ultimately to ensure batch-to-batch consistency.

Clinical Pharmacology

56. The completed maximal use study would not support the labeling that was
submitted with the BLA application. If you desire to seek the labeling which is
currently proposed, then you will need to conduct a new maximal use study
designed to address the systemic safety of your product and support the
proposed dosing regimens. In particular, you should ensure that you study
adequate numbers of patients that are treated with two applications of the
product who have % total body surface area (TBSA) within the upper range and
are treated with doses within the upper range to support systemic safety and
desired labeling.

57. If you choose to proceed with labeling in accordance with the currently completed
maximal use study, then labeling will be restrictive in terms of number of
applications, %TBSA and total dosing.

OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other
actions available under 21 CFR 601.3(b)). If you do not take one of these actions, we

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated November 20, 2020, which
constituted a complete response to our September 24, 2019, action letter.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated May 3, 2021, which was not
reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by
specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined

Comparative Analytical Assessment

3. The Agency’s evaluation of the January 27, 2020, third party Analytical Similar
Assessment Data Review Report identified several issues regarding data
omission in the analysis of G-CSF receptor binding by SPR © assay) as
indicated in the March 15, 2021 Information Request (IR). Your March 19, 2021
IR response did not adequately address the following issues, impacting the
reliability of the data provided to demonstrate that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-
licensed Neupogen:

(b) (4)

In addition, in Complete Response (CR) comment 2b in the CR letter dated
September 24, 2019, issues were raised regarding data omission for the competitive
binding ELISA assay. In the response to the March 15, 2021 IR, you provided a list
of all the runs and samples that were excluded from the analysis. However,
inadequate justification was provided for the exclusion of data with binding ratios

®® and replicates that do not appear to be identical. Given the number of runs
with binding ratios "" there is a concern that the method was not sufficiently
qualified for its intended use.

Overall, these issues raise concerns regarding the quality of the data from G-CSF
receptor binding analysis by SPR and competitive binding analysis by ELISA

submitted to support the comparative analytical assessment between TX01 and
U.S.-licensed Neupogen. Therefore, at this time, there is insufficient information to
make a determination that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Neupogen
notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components. To address
these issues, reliable data collected using binding assays that have been
demonstrated to be fit for their intended use are needed to support the comparative
evaluation of G-CSF receptor binding affinity between TX01 and U.S.-licensed
Neupogen. The analysis should include lots of the proposed TX01 commercial
material and TX01 lots used in the clinical studies. If TX01 lots from the clinical
studies are not available, TX01 material representative of the clinical process may
be acceptable with appropriate justification.

Humacao, PR 00791

Dear Ms. Martinez:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received July 7, 2022, and
your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act for Legubeti (acetylcysteine) for oral solution.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

CLINICAL

1. You have not provided data to demonstrate the tolerability of Legubeti, the lysine
salt of acetylcysteine, for the full range of loading and maintenance doses for
patients with all body weights proposed in labeling.

Both lysine and acetylcysteine have an unpleasant taste, and acetylcysteine has
an unpleasant odor that may affect the tolerability of oral ingestion. The data to
address the effect of the lysine on the palatability of Legubeti is inadequate. The
completed relative bioavailability study with Legubeti and the acetylcysteine oral
solution (a reference standard as a substitute for the relied-upon listed drug)
conducted with 1 gm of acetylcysteine is not adequate to address palatability
because most patients will receive higher doses (up to 15 gm) based on the
proposed weight-based dosage. Because timely administration of acetylcysteine
is essential to mitigate toxicity from acetaminophen overdose, uncertainty
remains as to whether ingestion of the full Legubeti dose can be administered,
either due to inadequate palatability or inadequate tolerability. Consequently,
these uncertainties place patients at increased risk of acetaminophen-induced
toxicity.

To resolve this deficiency conduct palatability and tolerability studies at clinically
relevant dose(s). The proposed Clinical investigation to address this deficiency

Reference ID: 5169156

NDA 215040
Page 2

should include a patient reported outcomes (PRO) instrument that is fit-for-
purpose. Before embarking on tolerability and palatability studies we recommend
reaching agreement with the Division of Clinical Outcomes Assessment (DCOA)
regarding your PRO to ensure it is valid.

You have not provided adequate information to support the safety of L-lysine
administration to pediatric patients weighing down to 1 kg. This information is
needed to inform the benefit-risk assessment of this product in the pediatric
population. The maximum daily amount of L-lysine expected to be administered
with Legubeti at the proposed dosage ranges from 502.6 mg/kg/day including the
loading dose on the first day to 313 mg/kg/day after completion of the
maintenance doses on the last day of treatment. The amount of L-lysine
expected to be delivered with the proposed dosage of Legubeti exceeds the
estimated daily intake of L-lysine in enterally fed term neonates.

To resolve this deficiency provide additional information (e.g., published literature
or a study) to justify the safety of the L-lysine exposure in pediatric patients down
to 1 kg, for the proposed indication.

REGULATORY

3. The relied-upon listed drug for this 505(b)(2) application is Mucomyst. You cited

the Cetylev prescribing information in order to comply with the Physician Labeling
Rule (PLR) and the Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Rule (PLLR). It is
acceptable to refer to the Cetylev label for the purpose of PLR and PLLR
formatting. However, if you are relying on FDA's finding of safety and/or
effectiveness for Cetylev (or another listed drug) concerning Lactation,
Pregnancy, and Females and Males of Reproductive Potential information, you
must comply with the legal/regulatory requirements for such reliance (e.g.,
establishing a scientific bridge, patent certification). Alternatively, you may rely on
non-product-specific published literature concerning Lactation, Pregnancy, and
Females and Males of Reproductive Potential to comply with PLLR.

To resolve this deficiency you may (1) cite and provide original publications
corroborating the proposed labeling language that are not based on FDA’s
finding of a listed drug (including the labeling of a listed drug); or (2) cite reliance
on Cetylev and comply with the legal/regulatory requirements for such reliance.

We have completed our review and find the information presented is inadequate. Therefore, the
application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the Act and 21 CFR 314.125(b). The

deficiencies are summarized as follows:

CLINICAL

We acknowledge that you have submitted three well-controlled studies (Studies 005, 006, and 013)
that show effectiveness for the adjunctive use of istradefylline 20mg, 40mg, and 60mg/day (without
clear evidence of dose response) in decreasing the percent of time awake spent in the OFF state in
patients with advanced Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Several other well-controlled studies of adequate
size, however, do not show such an effect and in one of those studies, Study EU-007, an active control,
entacapone, gave an almost significant result (p=0.06) while istradefylline showed essentially no
effect. Entacapone, moreover, had a favorable effect on the PGI, a patient-rated global measure in that
study, while istradefylline did not. These findings, taken together, establish effectiveness in
decreasing OFF time, but raise questions about the strength of the finding.

NDA 22-075

A more important problem, raising the critical
is raised by the uniform failure of the trials to
istradefylline or suggests meaningful benefit to patients. There
treatment contrasts favoring istradefylline compared to placebo

of functioning (e.g., CGI, SF-36). These resu

available treatments, but any inferiority should not represent a risk to patients. It could perhaps be
argued that these other treatments provide only symptomatic benefits, and that, substituting an

“inferior” treatment would pose no important harm to patients,

but we do not agree with this view.

Parkinson’s Disease is a serious disease, and effective symptomatic treatment can prevent serious
clinical outcomes (e.g., falls), even if the treatment has no effect on the underlying progression of the

illness, and inferior performance with respect to these other en

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

If you wish to pursue approval in the future we would like to inform you that the following Phase 4
commitments would be required:

1. A drug interaction study to investigate the inhibition potential of istradefylline on Pgp.

2. In vitro studies to explore the induction potential of istradefylline on CYP1A2. If there is such
a potential, an in vivo study may be necessary.

NONCLINICAL

Mineralization in the brain was first detected in the 2-year carcinogenicity study in the rat. As
requested by the Agency (cf. minutes of End-of-Phase 2 Meeting, September 23, 2003), you re-
examined brains from other toxicity studies in rat and dog and from the 2-year carcinogenicity study in
mouse. For the 4-, 13-, and 26-week studies in rat and the 2-year mouse study, your re-examination of
brain included cutting additional sections and employing a variety of stains (e.g., PAS, von Kossa,
alizarin red). Using these techniques, you detected a dose-related incidence of foci of mineralization in
brains in the 13- and 26-week rat studies, but not in the 2-year mouse study. It is not clear that similar
techniques were used to re-examine brains from the subchronic and chronic toxicity studies in dog.

You provided no overall summary of the methodology used and the results of the original and re-
examination of brain samples, or expert opinions regarding the nature of the mineralization and
possible relationship or lack of relationship to drug. This omission was particularly problematic since
data relevant to the finding of brain mineralization were located in numerous individual reports in
various files throughout your electronic submission. None of the electronic files was identified by
study title, only by study number. This made finding relevant studies (and overall review of the NDA)
unnecessarily burdensome, particularly since many of the pivotal studies had more than one identifying
number and related studies were not always cross-referenced.

In order for us to complete our evaluation of the brain mineralization finding, you will need to provide
an overall summary as described. If an expanded histopathology of brain was not conducted for dog as
was done in the rat and mouse, it should be conducted and the results submitted for review.

Within 10 days after the date of this letter, you are required to amend the application, notify us of your
intent to file an amendment, or follow one of your other options under 21 CFR 314.120. If you do not
follow one of these options, we will consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the
application under 21 CFR 314.65. Any amendment should respond to all the deficiencies listed. We
will not process a partial reply as a major amendment nor will the review clock be reactivated until all
deficiencies have been addressed.

Under 21 CFR 314.102(d), you may request a meeting or telephone conference with this division to
discuss what steps need to be taken before the application may be approved.

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this
application is approved.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL

Although we have concluded that cladribine is effective as a treatment for patients with
relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), safety concerns associated with its use
preclude its approval at this time.

Substantial evidence of cladribine’s effectiveness was provided by the CLARITY study.
This study was an adequate and well-controlled clinical study of oral cladribine in patients
with RRMS that was rigorously designed and executed. The effect of cladribine was
demonstrated by effects on relapse rate, disability progression, and various imaging markers
of disease activity. These findings were consistently demonstrated with multiple analyses
and are robust. We believe that the data, taken as a whole, meet the standard for substantial
evidence of effectiveness, as provided by one adequate and well controlled clinical trial and
confirmatory evidence.

Reference ID: 2910781

Reference ID: 4413345

NDA 022561
Page 2

These benefits of cladribine, however, are outweighed by its risks. The presence of a
disproportionate number of malignancies in cladribine-treated subjects represents an
unacceptable risk.

Cladribine clearly appears to be associated with an increased risk of malignancy. In the
CLARITY trial, there were four cases of malignancy in cladribine-treated subjects and none
in placebo-treated subjects. When considering the entire safety database, in completed
studies of cladribine and ongoing controlled studies of cladribine, there were 33 cases of
malignancy in cladribine-treated subjects and two in placebo-treated subjects. These
malignancies are found in a wide variety of anatomic sites. Analysis of a subset of these
patients revealed 8.2 cases of malignancy per 1000 cladribine-treated subjects (13 cases in
1579 subjects) in all oral cladribine trials worldwide and no cases in placebo. In trials of oral
cladribine in the U.S. the incidence was even higher with 18.3 cases of malignancy per 1000
subjects in cladribine treated subjects (3 cases in 164 subjects) and no cases in placebo.
Ongoing reporting of malignancy cases submitted throughout the review period appears to be
consistent with these rates. We analyzed whether increasing cumulative cladribine dose or
increasing duration of clinical monitoring played a role in the development of malignancy
but found no evidence of such relationship. We also investigated the latency from time of
first cladribine dose to time of malignancy diagnosis and found no evidence that any cases
occurred an implausibly short time following exposure to cladribine.

This increased risk of malignancy seen in cladribine-treated subjects as compared to placebo-
treated subjects is unacceptable. You must provide an improved understanding of this risk,
either through additional analyses or by conducting additional studies, before we could
consider approving this application.

We note that while you have agreed that the association between malignancies and cladribine
represents a potential significant safety concern, you have provided several arguments that
seek to address this concern. We have reviewed your arguments and do not agree with your
conclusions.

You have compared the rate of malignancy in cladribine-treated subjects to an expected
general population rate, calculated using epidemiologic data. Comparisons to epidemiologic
data are problematic, because rates of malignancy based on epidemiologic data vary greatly
according to many factors, including location, age, and gender. We are concerned that
comparing malignancy rates in cladribine-treated subjects to rates based on epidemiologic
data, as opposed to randomized controls, may not adequately account for important
differences between groups. We request additional information on the methods used in
calculating the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) described on pages 289-290 of the
Integrated Summary of Safety.

You have discussed that many malignancy cases in cladribine-treated subjects were cases of
cancer that rarely metastasize and are almost always curable by surgical resection (e.g., basal
cell carcinoma). We remain concerned, because an increased risk of malignancy in
cladribine-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects persists after excluding these
cases.

Reference ID: 2910781

Reference ID: 4413345

NDA 022561
Page 3

You have discussed that pre-existing risk factors have been documented in cladribine-treated
subjects with reported cases of malignancy. We remain concerned, as pre-existing risk
factors are likely to exist in some placebo-treated subjects, as well. We request clarification
on whether risk factors for malignancy were documented in all study subjects, and whether
an imbalance in pre-existing risk factors has been documented in cladribine-treated subjects
as compared to placebo-treated subjects.

You have discussed that the analyses of the long-term data are potentially biased due to
confounding by time since randomization. Although we agree that there is considerably
more long-term experience under treatment, compared to placebo, conditions, we note that
there is still a worrisome signal for malignancy in CLARITY. Although the maximum
duration of observation in CLARITY is 2 years, we believe that this is a sufficient duration
of exposure to cladribine to consider any malignancies occurring then to be biologically
plausible. Further, the signal seen in the long-term extension contributes to our concern,
given our lack of a detailed understanding of what rate of malignancies should be expected
over that duration of time.

You have discussed conducting a long-term prospective follow-up safety registry
(PREMIERE) to assess the risk of malignancies, as well as serious infections, lymphopenia,
and other adverse events of special interest in subjects with MS who have participated in
clinical trials of oral cladribine. We remain concerned, as it is unclear how this registry will
serve to mitigate the risk of malignancy. We request additional information on the
information to be collected and the planned methods for analysis, including details on how
the expected rates of adverse events will be determined.

We have the following additional comments that will need to be addressed, assuming you
can successfully respond to the previous concerns related to malignancies:

1. Cladribine causes a prompt and sustained decrease in absolute lymphocyte count occurring
shortly after exposure to cladribine. In the CLARITY study, a majority of subjects continued
to have significant lymphopenia at the time of last assessment. Ongoing lymphopenia is of
potential importance with regard to the development of infections and malignancies, and may
influence plans for repeat dosing. A clear understanding of lymphopenia in cladribine-
treated subjects is essential when considering its safety profile.

For this reason, you must ascertain the time to resolution of lymphopenia in cladribine-
treated subjects in CLARITY in order to better inform our decision about the ultimate
approvability of this application, and to provide appropriate guidance on the necessary
duration of hematologic monitoring.

2. Your plans for long-term dosing of cladribine are vague. Your submission and proposed
labeling provide no specific discussion of how dosing should be approached after the initial

cycles of treatment. You should clarify, and justify, the intended maximum dosing duration
of cladribine in clinical use.

3. There are several additional safety issues of concern that require the submission of additional
information. These requests for additional information include:

e Since patients with a history of taking disease-modifying drugs for multiple sclerosis may
have longer durations of immunosuppression than the general patient population, we
request analyses of malignancy risk and changes in hematologic laboratory measurements
for this subgroup of patients.

e Since most cases of malignancy in cladribine-treated subjects occurred in subjects over
age 40, we request analyses of malignancy risk stratified by age.

e Ifcladribine is taken with another agent that affects lymphocytes, additive adverse effects
leading to lymphopenia may occur. We request additional information, including which
specific medications may lead to these additive effects on lymphocytes, in order to
provide guidance on cladribine’s use.

Several other safety concerns also require the submission of additional information. Please see

the appendix to this letter for a complete list of our requests for additional information to be
submitted with any resubmission of this application.

PRODUCT QUALITY
1. The proposed dissolution specification of NLT |{}% of the labeled amount of cladribine
dissolved in 15 minutes (Q™) is not acceptable, as cladribine dissolution is very rapid with

more than w% dissolution within 15 minutes. You must tighten the dissolution specification
to NLT | {}% of labeled amount of cladribine dissolved in 15 minutes (Q™™).

I. Hematologic Toxicity and Hematologic Laboratory Measurements

.1. In Table 100 of the EMD Serono ISS, it is unclear what thresholds were used for classifying
Grade 1-4 decreases in White Blood Cell Counts. The central laboratory reference range lower

limit of normal in the CLARITY Trial for WBC count was 2.0 x 10°/L.' Thus, a WBC count of

2.0 x 10°/L is a threshold value for Toxicity Grades 1, 2, and 3 (see table below).

Laboratory

Leukocytes <LLN - 3000/mm* 3000 - 2000/mm°* 2000 - 1000/mm* 1000/mm°
(WBC) LLN-3.0x10°L 3.0-2.0x10°L 2.0-1.0x 10°L 1.0x10°L
Decreased
We request a revised version of Table 99 in the EMD Serono ISS with the actual numerical

laboratory cut-off values for the lower limits of normal and upper limits of normal used to

calculate each toxicity grade with or within the table.

1.2. Analyses reported in Table 108 of the EMD Serono Integrated Summary of Safety are
described as including only subjects whose Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia resolved during the 96
weeks of the studies; however, the upper range of time to resolution for all cladribine subjects is
202.6 weeks. Please clarify this apparent discrepancy.

1.3. We request additional information on the course of subjects with persistent hematologic
laboratory abnormalities after treatment with oral cladribine (beyond 96 weeks post-initial

therapy).

COMPLETE RESPONSE

Par Sterile Products, LLC

Attention: Carla English

Associate Director, Regulatory Affairs
Six Ram Ridge Road

Chestnut Ridge, NY 10977

Dear Ms. English:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated July 18, 2019, received July 18,
2019, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Micafungin for Injection, 50 mg/vial and 100 mg/vial.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated April 6, 2020, which was not
reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by
specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

PRODUCT QUALITY

1. Regarding the compatibility studies in your Pharmaceutical Development Report, we
note the assay values are )@mg/mL at time pyand jyHmg/mL at hours for the
5% dextrose diluted admixture of 100 mg drug product as shown in Table 7-4 on
page 126 of 134. The assay value of mg/mL is more than )%% off from the
target 0.5 mg/mL concentration and this could affect the efficacy of the drug product.
Conduct a root cause analysis to determine the reason for the low assay value. After
determining the cause and correcting, reconduct the assay test of the in-use-stability
study to support labeling.

2. Regarding the drug product specification:

a. The proposed acceptance criterion for Impurity s@is NMT 4%. Tighten the limit
to NMT 0.2% per ICH Q3B or provide toxicology data to justify the limit.

b. The proposed acceptance criterion for specified impurity at em is NUT

4%. The limit is above the qualification threshold. Justify the limit with
toxicology data. Alternatively, tighten the limit to NMT 0.2% per ICH Q3B.

Reference ID: 4610585

NDA 212156
Page 2

c. The limit NMT ®@% for any unspecified impurity is above the qualification
threshold. Tighten the limit per ICH Q3B.

NONCLINICAL

1.

Provide your revised leachables assessment, including the toxicological

assessment you planned to provide for 4 on July
31, 2020. The adequacy of your revised leachables study will be assessed at time
of resubmission.

As noted in the product quality comments above, the proposed acceptance criterion
for Impurity 9 (NMT ®%), impurity at © (NMT ®@%) and any unspecified
impurity (NMT 4%) are above the ICH Q3B qualification thresholds of NMT

0.2%. If the acceptance criterion cannot be tightened to NMT 0.2%, provide
adequate characterization for impurity at © and any unspecified
impurity(ies), along with a comprehensive toxicological assessment for all impurities
greater than 0.2% when administered intravenously. If sufficient toxicity information
is not available, additional nonclinical studies may be recommended to qualify the
safety of impurities > 0.2%.

Please refer to ICH Q3B(R1): Impurities in New Drug Products (available at
https://www.fda.gov/media/71733/download) and ICH M7(R1): Assessment and Control

of DNA Reactive (Mutagenic) Impurities in Pharmaceuticals To Limit Potential
Carcinogenic Risk (available at https://www.fda.gov/media/85885/download) for
additional information on the qualification of impurities in drug products.

deficiencies with the application as described in this letter. Please resubmit the
proposed proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described in
21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical
and clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication,
dosage form, or dose level.

(1) Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

(2) When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events

Reference ID: 5459701

(AE), serious adverse events (SAE), and common AEs, incorporate new safety
data as follows:

e Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed
indication using the same format as the original NDA submission.

e Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original NDA
data.

e Include tables that compare frequencies of AE in the original NDA with the

(3) Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by
incorporating the dropouts from the newly completed trials. Describe any new
trends or patterns identified.

(4) Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each subject who died
during a Clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an AE. In
addition, provide narrative summaries for SAEs.

(5) Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of
common, but less serious AEs between the new data and the original NDA data.

(6) Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number
of subjects, person time).

(7) Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of the drug. Include an
updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.

submitted.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments and requests for additional information that are not
approvability issues. However, we request you submit your responses with your
complete response to this letter.

Reference ID: 5459701

(1) We note that age and body weight are covariates for dasiglucagon exposure.
The lowest body weight enrolled in study 17103 was 4.1 kg. Therefore, no
clinical data was generated for infants < 4.1 kg.

You have not described any information regarding body weight in Section 2
Dosage and Administration of the submitted draft P|. Clarify how prescribers
should consider body weight when determining the dose of dasiglucagon.
Submit your proposal (i.e., draft Pl language) and justification with supporting
data for Section 2 Dosage and Administration regarding the impact of age
and body weight on dasiglucagon dosing.

Furthermore, we note that the simulated 95% confidence interval (Cl) upper
limit of dasiglucagon exposures (based on 70 microgram/hour dose) for body
weight < 4.1 kg is anticipated to exceed the peak plasma exposure of 3.78
nmol/L at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the transient
freezing absences in rats. Provide a justification with clinical safety data to
support a dosing recommendation for infants < 4.1 kg.

NDA 217724/Original 1
Page 5

(2) You propose to limit the indication statement based on chronological age i.e., to
pediatric patients with CHI who are at least 7 days old.

e We note that study 17103 excluded infants with chronological age < 7 days.
Clarify whether you anticipate any differences in the overall benefit/risk
assessment in infants < 7 days of age (including premature infants) as
compared to those 2 7 days of age.

e Clarify if you are proposing to include premature and term infants in the
proposed indication.

e We note that study 17103 excluded subjects < 34 weeks of gestational age.
Clarify if any premature infants were enrolled in study 17103.

(3) Comment on safety and efficacy considerations in small for gestational age
(SGA) and premature infants compared to term infants. Specifically, address the
following:

e Provide information on the impact of incomplete kidney development and
immature kidney physiology in premature infants on dasiglucagon
pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics compared to term infants with similar
body weight.

e Provide information on the impact of possible limited hepatic glycogen stores
in SGA and premature infants on efficacy of continuous subcutaneous (SC)
administration of dasiglucagon up to 3 weeks.

e Provide your justification for safety of continuous SC administration of
dasiglucagon up to 3 weeks in SGA and premature infants. Clarify how the
safety profile of dasiglucgon may differ between SGA and premature and
term infants and if SGA and premature infants may be at increased risk of
drug-related AEs due to physiologic immaturity. For example, we note that
AEs of hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia and metabolic acidosis have been
described in the literature as possibly associated with the off-label use of
glucagon products in premature and low birth weight infants‘.

In addition, provide your justification for safety of dasiglucagon in infants <
4.1 kg considering the simulated 95% Cl upper limit of dasiglucagon
exposures (based on 70 microgram/hour dose) for body weight < 4.1 kg is
anticipated to exceed the peak plasma exposure of 3.78 nmol/L at NOAEL
for the transient freezing absences in rats.

e Provide any other data and information related to the above request.

(4) Provide a justification for use of the infusion pump and infusion set in infants <
4.1 kg, including in premature infants. Clarify if you anticipate any technical
challenges in inserting and/or maintaining the infusion pump and infusion set in
lower weight or premature infants due to limited SC fat.

(5) The effect of moderate to severe renal impairment on dasiglucagon PK has not
been investigated. Submit your proposal for the product PI regarding renal
impairment with justification and supporting data.

Dear Ally Danta:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received June 30,
2023, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for CT-P43.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot
approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.
PRODUCT QUALITY MICROBIOLOGY

testing of CT-P43 drug product, 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) single-dose vial for IV
use is not validated to ensure reproducibility of results between different analysts.
The validation summary for the dye ingress method in Table 3.2.P.5.3-59
includes results for sensitivity, specificity, and robustness, however the
reproducibility of the visual detection method between different analysts is not
addressed. According to FDA guidance for industry “Analytical Procedures and
Methods Validation for Drugs and Biologics (2015)”, for non-compendial method,
validation data are needed to support the reproducibility of the method. Provide
evidence of the reproducibility of the visual inspection method to detect breach
sizes at the limit of detection with multiple analysts. Alternatively, measure all

samples by spectrophotometry and provide an updated method description with
acceptance criteria and submit additional method validation data accordingly.

PRODUCT QUALITY

(3) The proposed release and stability specifi ication for clarity of

for CT-P43 drug product (DP) [SCS] is
not acceptable because it is not justified by your clinical and manufacturing
experience. In your response to information request (IR), received on May 13,
2024, you proposed not to tighten this release and stability specification based
on ®® for Lot No. 2NGPO1
as justification. The proposed justification is not acceplable as it is not clinically
relevant. Results from should not be used to
support the release and long-term stability acceptance criteria. In addition, this
specification is not supported by the updated full term (36 months) stability data
from the primary stability (non-PPQ) batches provided in the same amendment in
SN 0027, which consistently showed results are below{NTU at all timepoints
throughout the product shelf life. Tighten the release and stability acceptance
criteria for clarity for CT-P43 [SCS] DP based on the historical release and long-
term stability results to ensure consistent quality of CT-P43 DP [SCS].

(4) The proposed shelf-life limit of ©® in CT-P43 45 mg/0.5 mL

and 90 mg/mL PFS and 130 mg/26 mL (5 mg/mL) Vial DP is not supported by
your clinical and manufacturing experience. In the IR response received on May

HUMAN FACTOR STUDY

We recommend the following comments be implemented prior to commencing the gemcitabine
hydrochloride in sodium chloride injection summative human factors study.

3. Review the protocol for inconsistencies. For example, error debrief is listed in the test
script, but not in the testing procedure description.

4. Clarify who the intended end user is for the proposed IFU. If the IFU is meant for nurses
and pharmacists, then it is unclear why body surface area (BSA) and Target Dose are
provided in the IFU. Revise the IFU to remove this information, or provide rationale for
including the BSA and Target Dose in the IFU.

5. It appears the proposed product is intended for patients with BSAs ranging from 1.2 mr to
2.6 m?; however, the IFU contains the statement

Clarify whether the proposed product is intended for use with patients with BSAs ranging
from 1.2 m? to 2.6 m/, or if it is only intended for use with the specific BSAs listed in the
IFU table (e.g. 1.2 m’, 1.3 m?, 1.4 m2, etc.).

a. If it’s intended for the range of BSAs from 1.2 m? to 2.6 m’, then provide
prescribing instructions on dose banding and clarification on how dose banding
should be performed for BSA values with two decimal places. For example, if a
patient has a BSA of 1.75 m? and requires a dose of 1,000 mg/m? (calculated dose
is 1,750 mg), then is the correct dose after dose banding 1700 mg, or 1800 mg?

db. If it’s intended for the specific BSAs listed in the IFU table, then evaluate the
effectiveness of the statement “For the treatment...” under step 1 of IFU in the
human factors study to provide assurance that nurses and pharmacists will not use
the proposed product for a patient with BSA of 1.75 m2.

6. To better simulate a real life scenario in the identification and differentiation of tasks, the
IFU may be provided to the human factor study participants, but do not instruct the
participant to review the IFU prior to receiving their prescription card in the human factor
study. In the usual clinical setting, the end user (pharmacist or nurse) would receive the
prescription first. If the end user needs help with interpretation or calculation of dose, he
or she would have the option to refer to the PI and/or IFU that are packaged with the
drug.

7. Nurses will be required to administer two bags in some cases. We recommend inclusion

of tasks that would assess how effective the product labeling and the IFU are in
addressing the risk of omission of the second bag to be infused by the nurse.

PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

8. As currently proposed, the prescriber would not be aware that the pharmacist or nurse
could potentially round the prescribed dose to available bag strength. This rounding of
dose without notifying the prescriber could possibly be regarded as prescribing by the
nurse or pharmacist. Thus, your currently proposed labeling plan could be error prone.
You should consider incorporating a table in the Dosage and Administration section of
the Prescribing Information that instructs the prescriber to round the dose.

Joppa, MD 21085

Dear Dr. Rowland:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated October 31, 2020,
received November 2, 2020, submitted under section 351 (a) of the Public Health
Service Act for PRV-031.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 15, April 28, May 18,
May 27, June 7, and June 25 (eCTD #56), 2021, which were not reviewed for this
action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendments by specific
reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

(1) The results of the pharmacokinetic (PK) bridging study PRV-031-004' in
healthy volunteers failed to show PK comparability between the PRV-031
product used in TN-102 and the planned commercial product. Study
PRV-031-004 revealed considerable differences in the total area under the
time-concentration curve extrapolated to infinity (AUCo-int) between the two
products, with the planned commercial product providing an approximately {/f4j%
lower AUC.int, despite a comparable Cmax after a single intravenous infusion.
As PK remains the primary endpoint for demonstration of comparability
between the two products, you will need to establish PK comparability
appropriately between the intended commercial product and the clinical trial

Evaluate the Bio comparability of Teplizumab (PRV-031) Manufactured at Two Sites

product, or provide other data that adequately justify why PK comparability is
not necessary.

PRODUCT QUALITY

(2) Results of your ongoing real-time stability studies demonstrate unacceptable
charge variation measured in PRV-031 drug substance manufactured at AGC
Biologics and the resulting drug product under recommended storage
conditions. For instance,

either drug substance or drug product, not only because of the unacceptable
degree of change, but also because stability behavior is not consistent between
drug product lots manufactured using AGC material. This degree of change
also prevents a determination as to whether there is a problem with product
stability, the method, or both. Finally, the possibility that this variation arises
from method variability also introduces uncertainty into the reliability of all
results generated with this method, including the analytical comparability
assessment, highlighted by the difference in stability behavior between AGC
lots and lots manufactured by Eli Lilly. To address these deficiencies:

a. Provide data and information regarding the source of the variability of the
PRV-031 drug product and drug substance charge profile on stability as
measured by the CEX-HPLC assay.

b. Address and remediate the source of the charge variation of PRV-031
manufactured at AGC.

c. Address the differences in PRV-031 stability behavior between clinical
material manufactured at Eli Lilly and proposed commercial material
manufactured at AGC Biologics.

d. If changes are made to the CEX-HPLC assay as a result of the
investigation, provide data and information to support that these changes
to the CEX-HPLC assay do not impact the data to support this application.
This should include, but not be limited to, batch release data, stability
data, in-process testing, process characterization studies, and the
comparability assessment between the clinical material manufactured at
Eli Lilly and the proposed commercial material manufactured at AGC
Biologics.

No information was provided in Section 3.2.S.2.3 regarding your plans to
monitor Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) stability. To
correct this deficiency, provide cell bank requalification protocols for the MCB
and WCB to include, but not be limited to, the frequency of testing, a
justification for this frequency, number of vials proposed to be tested at each
testing timepoint, tests proposed/parameters to be evaluated, and appropriately
justified acceptance criteria.

The protocol provided in your submission dated March 31, 2021, for
requalification of the primary reference standard (PRS) is deficient. The
requalification protocol should ensure that the PRS remains stable over time
and remains suitable for its intended purpose. In order to accomplish this,
address the following:

(5) Insufficient information was provided regarding the levels and types of
leachates in PRV-031 derived from its container closure and the risk to patients
from any leachates that are potentially present in the drug product during its
shelf life. To address this deficiency, provide sufficient data from a leachable
study to evaluate the filled drug product container closure systems when stored
inverted under the recommended conditions. Perform testing at regular
intervals through the end of shelf-life to include appropriate methods to detect,
identify, and quantify organic non-volatile (e.g., HPLC-UV-MS), volatile (e.g.,
headspace GC-MS) and semi-volatile (e.g., GC-MS) species and metals (e.g.,
ICP-MS).

Dear Ms. Valentine:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated July 31, 2014, received July 31, 2014,
submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for
Lutrate® Depot (leuprolide acetate for injection), fe 22.5 mg/vial.

We have completed our review of this application, and have determined that we cannot approve
this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and,
where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL/STATISTICAL

1. In the approval of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists for the palliative treatment of
advanced prostate cancer, testosterone levels serve as a surrogate marker of efficacy. When
all available testosterone levels are used in the analysis, nn)
Lutrate Depot 22.5 mg failed to achieve and maintain castrate testosterone levels in an
acceptable percentage of patients.

testosterone levels between Daya! 28-168 in 83.9% of patients. Further, the results of these
studies are difficult to interpret since there may have been marked variations in dose due to
the extent of overfill in each Lutrate vial.

To address this deficiency, you should optimize your formulations ere el
(uutate Depot 22.5 mg and conduct additional clinical trials to demonstrate the safety
and efficacy of your products.

PRODUCT QUALITY

2. The batch formula cannot accurately reflect drug product composition because batches were

manufactured with different amounts of excipients. Provide a batch formula that reflects the
proposed composition of the drug product registration batches.

4. You did not provide new information about overfill; however, you referenced Section

3.2.P.2.3.2.4 regarding the justifications provided in the original NDA. Provide justifications
but NOT calculations to estimate the amount of SS

5. The chemical physical properties of the drug substance have to be generated from the actual
drug substance batches produced from manufacture. Provide chemical and physical
properties of the drug substance from your manufactured batches.

6. The stability of the three primary batches of drug substance and drug product is not
acceptable because no stability data for the drug substance were provided in the NDA. We
consider the provided drug product stability data to only be supportive since they were
obtained from annual reports. In addition, these data were collected from drug product
batches obtained from marketed product available in foreign countries and packaged in a
different packaging configuration. Based on the above information, expiry dating for the
drug substance and drug product cannot be established. Provide a stability study and related

COMPLETE RESPONSE

Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Attention: Patti Neall

Executive Director, Regulatory Affairs
10 N. High Street, Suite 200

West Chester, PA 19380

Dear Ms. Neall:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received
September 13, 2019, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act for cantharidin topical solution, 7%.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot
approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated May 15 and 29;

June 5 and 11, 2020, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate
applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to
the deficiencies cited in this letter.

PRODUCT QUALITY

(1) The proposed drug product specification does not include test to assure the drug
product can be safety and accurately expelled onto the lesion area and avoid the
adjacent healthy skin. The specification for the final assembled drug product
should be revised to include the following:

a. A test for the crushing force of the glass ampule.

b. A leakage test after ampule crushing to assure there is no drug leakage at
release and during shelf-life.

c. A droplet test to demonstrate that the users are capable of dispensing
various amount of drug product as needed to the affected skin area while
avoiding the adjacent healthy skin.

(2) The extraction solutions, ®® used in the
extractable/leachable study are considered inadequate because:

Reference ID: 4639627

NDA 212905

Page 2

b. Leachable compounds were detected during drug product testing for
related substances that were not detected in the extractable studies.
Extractable/leachable studies you have committed to in the amendment
dated January 23, 2020 should be conducted and the results of these
studies should be submitted to the application.

(3) The drug product quality is not assured and the expiration dating period cannot

be established because the registration drug product batches provided in the
application were not fully assembled ae In order to assure the drug

product quality and established expiration dating period for the drug product, at
least 3 months of long-term and accelerated stability data from three batches of
fully assembled drug product with at least 3 times-points post

manufacture (at initial, 1 months, 2 months, and 3 months) should be submitted
to the application.

FACILITIES

(4) Our field investigator could not complete inspection of the manufacturing facili
cause the facility was not ready for inspection. Satisfactory inspection is
required before this NDA can be approved. Please notify us in writing when this
facility is ready for inspection.

(5) We have not completed our inspection of your
manufacturing facili
avel restrictions associated wi 5 it i i

andemic. An inspection of

listed manufacturing operations in compliance with CGMP.

PROCESS

Reference ID: 4639627

NDA 212905
Page 3

HUMAN FACTORS

(11)As we previously communicated, our review of the human factors (HF) validation
study data noted use errors and difficulties with the critical task- ‘Break the
Ampule’. We note one use error and three difficulties with the critical task. The
use error occurred when the user removed the cap and paperboard sleeve, tipped
the applicator upside down and broke the ampule with two hands. Additionally,
three other users had difficulty breaking the ampule, which required two hands to
break. Of these three use difficulties, one user also tilted the applicator
horizontally. Based on your use-related risk analysis (URRA), this task is
considered critical because premature cap removal and incorrect applicator
orientation can lead to accidental exposure to the patient or healthcare provider's
(HCP’s) mouth or eyes leading to serious harm. Despite the use error and
difficulties with critical task, you did not propose any additional mitigation
strategies to address the use issues (e.g., reducing the force required to break the
ampule).

We note your heuristic analysis submitted on April 10, 2020 indicates that the
average palmar pinch force (grip used to break an ampule) for adult females is 16
lbs. and that the average force to break the ampule with paperboard sleeve on is
19 lbs. From this information you concluded that the force to break the ampule

Reference ID: 4639627

NDA 212905
Page 4

could increase the potential for use errors - “there is a potential that users will
struggle to break the glass ampule due to the amount of force required. There is
risk that some users may remove the paperboard sleeve in order to try and break
the glass ampule. There is also potential for users to utilize other means to break
the ampule if they are unable to generate enough force with their hands.”

We also reviewed your April 10, 2020 threshold/comparative analyses with Eskata
and Levulan Kerastick; products with some similarities to the proposed product in
this review. We determined that the Levulan Kerastick has a different user
interface than your proposed product because the Levulan Kerastick includes the
Kerastick Krusher device as a means of breaking the ampule prior to
administration. This difference may impact performance of the critical task of
breaking the ampule. Furthermore, with respect to the comparative analyses to
the Eskata product, we note postmarketing medication error cases that report
accidental exposure to patient and health care professionals when using the
product. Given some of the similar design attributes with your proposed product,
we are concerned that accidental exposure can occur with cantharidin topical
solution, which may present a different risk. As such, we have determined that a
leveraging approach for your proposed product is not appropriate and the residual
risk with your product is unacceptable.

n summary, we remain concerned that your proposed cantharidin combination
product is not safe for use by HCPs. We are concerned that the risk of accidental
exposure will outweigh the benefit of the treatment with this combination product.
nherent design issues exist with this product that may contribute to serious harm
if accidental exposure occurs during use. Thus, additional mitigation strategies are
needed and could include the need for device design changes to optimize
applicator use along with other revisions to the product user interface taking into
consideration our previously identified concerns and the data collected from your
HF validation study. After you implement additional risk mitigation
strategies/modifications, we recommend you conduct an additional HF validation
study to ensure that these modifications address the observed use errors and use
difficulties and do not introduce any new risks.

We recommend you submit your revised HF validation study protocol for feedback
from the Agency before commencing the study. Please note we will need 60 days
to review and provide comments on the HF validation study protocol. Plan your
development program timeline accordingly.

As you further develop your proposed product and prepare your next human
factors study protocol to address the above concerns, we have the following
additional recommendations:

a. You indicated in your comparative analysis submitted on April 10, 2020
that the Levulan Kerastick product is similar to your proposed product. We
note the Kerastick Krusher device has a means of breaking the ampule

Reference ID: 4639627

NDA 212905
Page 5

prior to administration that differs from your product. The design of the
Levulan Kerastick product may inform how you address the break force
issues identified during your human factors product development.

b. We noted use errors, difficulties, and subjective feedback indicating
concerns with the readability of the Instructions for Use (IFU), but you
have not proposed additional risk mitigation strategies to address the use
errors and difficulties. Thus, we recommend additional mitigation
strategies to address these use errors and difficulties as part of the overall
changes to the user interface.

c. We disagree with your characterization of some tasks as non-critical.
Tasks that could cause harm to users, as noted in your URRA, should be
noted as critical tasks (e.g. Inspect Applicator; a

Apply Solution; and Allow Solution to Dry). Additionally,
we note that the task ‘Remove Cap’ in your URRA does not assess the
risk of incorrect timing of cap removal, which can increase the risk of
accidental exposure. Because of the potential for causing harm to the
user or patient, these tasks should be re-categorized as critical tasks in
your updated URRA.

Attention: Thomas Chaly, Ph.D., FAIC

Chief, Cyclotron — Radiochemistry Department
350 Community Drive

Manhasset, NY 11030

Dear Dr. Chaly:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated October 29, 2009, received October 30, 2009,
and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act for Fluorodopa F 18 Injection, 0.42 mCi/mL to 8.33 mCi/ml.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated December 15, 2015, which constituted a
complete response to our October 22, 2013, action letter.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated April 11, 2016, which extended the
goal date by three months.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated August 31, 2016, which was not
reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific
reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL / STATISTICAL

Your resubmitted application contained the report of the prospectively designed “Study #17” which
aimed to evaluate Fluorodopa F 18 for: 1) sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility in the differential
diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndromes, 2) inter-reader reliability, 3) quantitative correlation with
Parkinson’s disease diagnosis, and 4) safety by monitoring for adverse events. This study does not
provide sufficient confirmatory evidence of effectiveness and the Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan’s
performance is not adequately characterized.

In Study #17, 45 movement disorder patients were imaged with Fluorodopa F 18. Of these patients,

32 had images interpreted as positive for visualization of a loss of dopaminergic neurons in striatum and
13 were interpreted as negative.

Reference ID: 3986392

NDA 200655
Page 2

Out of these 13 patients, only 5 patients had undergone a clinical follow up which was to serve as a
standard of reference and only 1 of these patients had a clinical follow up at a pre-defined time interval
following the Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan (>1 year). Some patients had an interval as short as one or two
weeks. Therefore, out of 13 patients with no loss of dopaminergic neurons in striatum as visualized with
Fluorodopa F 18, only 1 patient had this interpretation adequately verified.

Additionally, the image interpretations were known to the clinicians providing follow-up prior to their
determination of the clinical diagnosis. Because the clinician was responsible for making the
assessment of the clinical diagnosis, which served as the standard of reference, it is possible that the
results of the test influenced their a: s is not acceptable as a standard of reference and is
not adequate for support of the proposed visualization claim.

Furthermore, we note that in patients with “positive” images, only 20 patients had a standard of
reference obtained | year or more following imaging with Fluorodopa F 18. Most patients did not
have 1 year of follow-up. This is also inadequate.

The three readers agreed with each other on the interpretation of the scans in 98% (44 of 45 images)
of the patients. It is not clear what clinical information was provided to the readers or the amount of
independence from each other they had in making the reads.

Going forward, it is important to develop a plan to address these deficiencies. It will need to include a
method to make a clinical assessment of the patients’ clinical diagnosis that is not influenced by the
results of the image reads. This will include obtaining complete follow up on all of the subjects. You
may extend Study #17 to enroll additional patients who will also go on to have a clinical follow up at a
pre-defined interval as an adequate standard of reference. The deficiencies with the study protocol and
conduct of the study will need to be corrected as you go forward. You should also clearly document
which clinical features in each patient were consistent with Parkinsonian or non-Parkinsonian syndrome.

You may consider requesting a meeting to discuss the design of an appropriate statistical analysis
plan for the completion and extension of Study #17.

PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate.

Attention: Andrew Sansone, MS

Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, Quality & Safety, North America

Cambridge, MA 02142

Dear Mr. Sansone:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received April 29, 2022, and
your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act for palovarotene capsules.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated October 19, 2022, which was
not fully reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the
amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in
his letter. We refer you to the ICH guidance for industry S$1B(R1) Addendum to S1B
Testing for Carcinogenicity of Pharmaceuticals' for specific weight of evidence (WoE)
criteria and to aid in applying the WoE approach for assessing human carcinogenic risk.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
hat we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
hese issues.

You have not provided adequate support for the efficacy of palovarotene, thus the
anticipated clinical benefit in the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with
ibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), specifically a benefit of palovarotene to
prevent the formation of new heterotopic ossification (HO) (the proposed indication),
has not been established.

Major review issues that remain unresolved include:
1) Appropriateness of reliance on post-hoc analyses to support efficacy.

2) Acceptability of the external control group (the Natural History Study, NHS) for
evaluation of efficacy of the chronic/flare-up dosing regimen.

1 We update guidances periodically. For the most recent version of a guidance, check the FDA Guidance
Documents Database https://www.fda.gov/Regulatorylnformation/Guidances/default.htm.

4)

Uncertain implications of the observed negative new HO volume data.

Lack of demonstration of efficacy of flare-up-only dosing the phase 2 studies, and
inconsistency in the efficacy data pertaining to chronic/flare-up dosing between
phase 2 and phase 3 data.

The imbalance in flare-ups between palovarotene-treated patients and non-
treated patients in the palovarotene clinical studies. Palovarotene is intended to
prevent the formation of new HO, and flare-ups are associated with HO
formation. The potential for increased incidence of flare-ups with palovarotene
treatment, particularly with higher doses, is a concern regarding both the efficacy
and safety of the drug in patients with FOP.

Unclear plan for demonstration of substantial evidence of effectiveness as
described in guidance for industry, Demonstrating Substantial Evidence of
Effectiveness for Human Drug and Biological Products, e.g., if you intend to rely
on a single adequate and well controlled trial, you will need to provide
confirmatory evidence of effectiveness.

As a path forward we recommend that the following additional data and data analyses
as well as any other available data that may support the efficacy of palovarotene be
submitted. Additional data and analyses should include all data out to clinical study

close-out:

1)

Data pertaining to the number of new sites of HO in Studies PVO-1A-202 B/C
(202 B/C) and PVO-1A-301 (301) and the NHS, including whether new HO noted
on post-baseline imaging was classified as ‘new lesion’ or ‘enlarged lesion’ or
‘both new and enlarged lesion.”

Annualized new HO summary statistics for ‘Pre-pause,’ ‘Interruption,’ and
‘Re-start’ periods in Study 301 and 202B/C.

Analyses comparing annualized new HO of treated subjects with untreated
subjects from the NHS using all available data. The combined populations of
202B and 202C should be used. Based on the similar protocols for Studies 202C
and 301, it would also be acceptable to conduct separate analyses for 202C. The
analyses should consider, but not be limited to, the following different
combinations of populations, analyses methods and calculation of endpoints.

a. Analysis population for comparison
i. Study 202 B/C versus NHS
ii. Study 301 and Study 202 B/C pooled versus NHS
iii. Study 301 and Study 202 B/C (like two active arms) versus NHS

b. Analysis method
i. Generalized estimating equation
ii. Wilcoxon rank sum test (if applicable)

c. Matching and weighting:

i. None (not matched or weighted)

ii. Matching or weighting based on propensity score: For matching,
treated subjects should be matched with NHS subjects who share
similar baseline characteristics. Subjects should be exactly
matched on sex and possibly age group depending on number of
subjects that could be exactly matched. Conduct matching using
different methods such as nearest neighbor and optimal matching
on other covariates. Balances of selected baseline covariates
should be assessed before and after weighting or matching.
Discuss and interpret the findings from the different matching or
weighting analyses.

d. Covariates for analyses, matching and weighting
i. Baseline age, sex, total HO
ii. Baseline age, sex, total HO, cumulative analogue joint involvement
scale (CAuIS), time since last flare up (may have more missing
data)

e. Annualized new HO (use the original study baseline regardless of dosing
stop)

i. Calculated using the last available observation

ii. Calculated using the 12-month visit window data if available;
otherwise using the observation closest to Month 12

iii. Calculated using the 24-month visit window (applicable to Study
202 B/C vs NHS comparison)

iv. Calculated using the 36-month visit window (applicable to
Study 202 B/C vs NHS comparison)

4) Perform within-subject analyses:

a. Comparing the annualized new HO under palovarotene treatment with the
annualized new HO observed in the NHS among NHS subjects who
transferred to Study 202 B/C. Plot the average change in total HO from
baseline vs visit month by study. The plots should indicate the number of
subjects at each visit.

b. Comparing the annualized new HO under palovarotene treatment with the
annualized new HO observed in the NHS among NHS subjects who
transferred to either Study 202 B/C or Study 301. Plot the average change
in total HO from baseline vs visit month by study. The plots should indicate
the number of subjects at each visit.

Provide a graph depicting the average change in total HO volume by visit month
for Study 202 B/C subjects who had a similar dosing regimen and enrollment
criteria as Study 301 subjects. Provide an additional graph with average change
in total HO volume from baseline further depicted by grouping subjects based on
whether the subjects were newly enrolled into Study 202C, or from the NHS
directly, or from Study 202B. Provide similar graphs for total HO volume instead
of change in total HO volume.

For subjects who transferred from the NHS to Study 202, provide the dates and
total HO volumes of the end of NHS CT scan and the baseline scan of

Study 202, as well as the difference between dates and volumes. For subjects
whose end of NHS study CT scans were re-read for the baseline total HO
volume for Study 202, perform a simple linear regression analysis of the baseline
total volume in Study 202 with the HO volume at the end of the NHS as the
independent variable and provide the regression plots and results.

Given the different results on WBCT volume from Study 202 B/C and 301,
provide an exploration of the differences that may explain the disparate results
seen. This should include analyses of differences in age, sex, disease severity
and flare-up history. These analyses should also provide information on a
potential population in whom palovarotene has clear benefit.

In Studies 202 B/C and 301, perform analyses of the relationship between
incidence/rate of flare-ups (defined as including Aes of ‘condition aggravated’)
and development of new HO, and between the extent of flare-up dosing and
development of new HO.

For each of the 4 studies (301, 202B, 202C and NHS), populate the following
table using “pre-pause” data. For Study 202B, include both treated flare-ups and
Aes of ‘condition aggravated.’

Provide an assessment of the potential impact of self-selection of NHS subjects
on the results for change in new HO volume by WBCT comparing Studies 301
and 202 B/C with the NHS.

a. Consider a marginal structural model to account for time-varying binary
exposure of palovarotene chronic treatment and continuous HO volume by
WBCT as time-depending confounder, using all data combined from the
NHS, Study 301, and Study 202 B/C populations. Also consider age and
stratify by sex in the model.

b. If a marginal structural model is deemed infeasible, based on the
limitations of the current data, please provide your assessment of
feasibility, and propose sensitivity analyses to address the potential
selection bias when comparing Studies 301 and 202 B/C with NHS
subjects.

Create a dataset for Study 202 B/C subjects with the same structure and
variables as the ADHOV4 dataset such that the two datasets can be combined.
You should include all available WBCT data in the two datasets regardless of
whether the CT scan was obtained after dosing was stopped. Data before dosing
stop or any cut-off date should be able to be obtained by simple sub-setting by
date. Additionally, add relevant baseline variables such as those listed in 3) d.ii
and the following information from CAuIS to the new dataset and the ADHOV4
dataset: whether the subject can walk, uses a wheelchair, needs some help with
activities of daily living, needs complete help with activities of daily living. Create
an indictor variable for subjects who transferred from the NHS to Study 202 B/C.

Submit a guidance document for all programs and datasets used for generating
results for this information request. For subjects who participated in multiple
studies, a unique subject identification should be provided such that all data for
the same subject can be traced across studies.

POSTMARKETING REQUIREMENTS UNDER 505(0)(3)

Section 505(0)(3) of the FDCA authorizes FDA to require holders of approved drug and
biological product applications to conduct postmarketing studies and clinical trials for
certain purposes, if FDA makes certain findings required by the statute.

We have determined that if NDA 215559 is approved, an analysis of spontaneous
postmarketing adverse events reported under subsection 505(k)(1) of the FDCA will not
be sufficient to assess a signal of a serious risk of increased palovarotene exposures in
subjects with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.

Furthermore, the active postmarket risk identification and analysis system as available
under section 505(k)(3) of the FDCA will not be sufficient to assess this serious risk.

Finally, we have determined that only a clinical trial (rather than a nonclinical or
observational study) will be sufficient to assess a signal of a serious risk of increased
palovarotene exposures in subjects with moderate-to-severe hepatic impairment.

Therefore, based on appropriate scientific data, FDA has determined that, if
NDA 215559 is approved, you will be required to conduct the following:

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:
Because the benefits of palovarotene for treatment of patients with FOP have not been
established, we are unable to conduct a meaningful benefit risk assessment. The
palovarotene related risks identified during our review will be considered in the context
of benefit in your future resubmission. Benefits must outweigh risks for us to approve
your application.

400 N. Washington Street, Suite 100
Alexandria, VA 22314

Attention: Kelly T. Boyle
CFO, Biologics Consulting Group

Dear Ms. Boyle:

Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated May 25, 2017, received May 25,
2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for
SB4.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

PRODUCT QUALITY

1. The data and information provided in your response on January 12, and February 14,
2018, to the Agency’s information requests (IRs) dated December 19, 2017 (IR #13)
and February 7, 2018 (IR #1) demonstrate that the primary reference standard (PRS)
was not appropriately qualified with respect to biological activity (i.e., TNF-a binding
activity and TNF-a neutralization activity) and protein concentration, and therefore, is
not appropriate for its intended use. Because the PRS was not appropriately
qualified, the working reference standard (WRS), which was qualified against the
PRS, is also not appropriate for its intended use. Therefore, there is a lack of
assurance that the commercial materials are not going to drift from SB4 clinical
materials and the materials used to establish the analytical similarity.

a. Generate an appropriately qualified reference material based on the advice
provided in the Agency’s IRs dated December 19, 2017 and February 7, 2018.
Upon the generation of the new qualified reference material, provide data to
adequately link this material to the materials used in the clinical studies and
analytical similarity assessment. We recommend using a two-tiered system
for utilizing reference standard material for routine testing of commercial
product.

Reference ID: 4238872

BLA 761066
Page 2

b. Re-assess and revise SB4 drug substance and drug product lot release and
stability specifications, as appropriate.

c. Re-test the currently manufactured SB4 lots for release and stability using the
appropriately qualified reference material, as appropriate, if these lots are
intended to be released for commercial use in the US.

d. Provide an updated requalification protocol for the reference material (e.g.
primary and working reference standards) to include the advice that was given
in the Agency’s information requests dated December 19, 2017, and February
7, 2018.

2. The data and information provided in the submission and in your response dated
February 13, 2018, to the Agency’s information request dated February 2, 2018

Taken together, the overall control strategy for the
ture process is inadequate and requires additional levels of control.
To ensure product quality and cell culture process consistency, implement the
following controls and update all the appropriate sections of the BLA with this
information:

a. Establish LIVCA using an appropriate cell culture model that is sufficiently
sentative of the commercial cell culture

b. Establish key controlled ter (KCPs) for

limit of

The information provided in the submission and in the responses received by the
Agency on February 2, 6, and 14, 2018, and during the teleconference held with the
Agency on February 8, 2018, is not adequate to support that the currently proposed
drug product filling control strategy provides sufficient assurance that each pre-filled
syringe (PFS) is filled with sufficient SB4 product to meet the current US label claim
of 50 mg/mL and 25 mg/0.5mL for Enbrel.

a. Although the protein concentration for drug product process validation
batches filled at are within the acceptance criterion
range of at release, the protein concentration is consistently less
than 50 mg/mL while the drug substance lots used to fill these drug product
lots did not have this issue. For example, drug substance lot 15-602E-002 had
a protein concentration of a) at release and the resulting drug
product lot, 00003, had a protein concentration o: Because the
drug product is OM itis
unclear why there is such variability between the drug substance protein
concentration and the subsequent drug product protein concentration. Explain
this discrepancy.

b. While the labeling allows oO when
considering the control strategy, the current criteria would allow the release of
PFS filled outside appropriate limits. The 50 mg/mL syringes may be
underfilled, because a volume o: deliverable volume) is
allowed, and the 25 mg/0.5 mL syringes may be filled to an inappropriately
high level of deliverable volume). As requested previously
on February 7, 2018, revise the lower limits for extractable volume (Section

3.2.P.5.1) and ©® (Section 3.2.P.3.3) for the 50 mg/mL syringe (i.e.,
increase the extractable volume criterion from , and
revise the upper limits for extractable volume and for the 25 “Sel

c. In the IR response received by the Agency on February 6, 2018, (Question 1)
and during the teleconference with the Agency on February 8, 2018,
insufficient information was provided regarding the filling control strategy
including how © is monitored and controlled and how

excursions are investigated and handled. For both
PY provide a detailed description in Section 3.2.P.3.3 of how the
® is controlled in real time during manufacturing. Include the
monitoring frequency, number of samples taken, and rejection/action and alert
limits.

BLA 761066

| Clearly define the actions
taken when samples are outside the rejection/action limit; these should include
activities such egregation of the portion of the lot associated with the out
of range sample(s), on

4. The information and data provided to support the commercial drug product shipping
do not provide sufficient assurance that the quality of the DP is maintained during
commercial shipping and distribution. The air transport simulation study parameters
tested are not representative of routine distribution conditions and cannot on their
own be used in lieu of performing real-time DP shipping validation studies. In
addition, it is unclear how the supply chain cycling study (Section 3.2.P.8.1) can be
used to support the validation of shipping of the drug product from either Mo

© pp manufacturing sites. Provide shipping validation data for the drug
product from real-time shipping studies or from studies that are sufficiently
representative of the commercial shipping conditions. The data should include an
assessment of product quality pre- and post-shipping. Include a detailed description
of how the study was performed and if performed using simulated studies, provide a
justification for how the simulated studies are sufficiently representative of the
commercial shipping conditions.

5. As requested in an IR, dated February 6, 2018 and via teleconference with the
Agency on February 8, 2018, update the drug product manufacturing process in
Section 3.2.P.3.3 to ensure that samples for identity testing for drug product release
will be taken after the labeling operations have been completed to comply with 21
CFR 610.14.

6. The sterilization validation data provided to support the ©® sterilization of

items used to manufacture SB4 at PM) was deficient, as there is no minimum

© validated. Inadequate validation of sterile product-contact
equipment may result in a non-sterile product. Provide sterilization validation for the
minimum ™® in the BLA resubmission.

7. The BLA does not include ™® as acritical process parameter for
sterile filtration. Performing sterile filtration outside of the parameters validated by
the microbial retention study may result in a non-sterile product. Include the sterile
filtration © as acritical process parameter and provide the
respective acceptance criteria in section 3.2.P.3.4.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

We do not agree that the information provided on February 13, 2018, is adequate in
response to the Agency’s IR on February 7, 2018 (IR #2) for the classification of aa

s non-key control parameters. Upgrade these
process parameters to key-controlled parameters (KCPs). In addition, the

the upper end of the range to “™** based on data provided in the viral clearance
studies. Update Section 3.2.S.2.2 or Section 3.2.S.2.4 as appropriate.

The response received on February 6, 2018, to the Agency’s information request on
January 29, 2018 (IR #1 and #2) regarding the revision of acceptance criteria for release
and stability was not adequate. The following acceptance criteria should be revised (see
also comment 1b under “Product Quality”) based on information provided in the
resubmission and in the IR response on February 6, 2018, and Sections 3.2.S.5.1 and
3.2.P.5.1 updated accordingly:

a. The upper end of the acceptance criteria for the TNF-a binding assay should be
lowered for DS and DP at release and stability.

b. The upper end of the acceptance criteria for the TNF-a neutralization assay
should be lowered for DS and DP at release and stability.

c. The acceptance criteria for HIC peak 2 and peak 3 should be tightened further for
DS and DP at release and stability.

d. DP stability acceptance criterion for HMWS by SEC method should be tightened
further.

Attention: Sheila Mathias, PhD
Senior Director, Regulatory Affairs

Dear Dr. Mathias:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received July 19, 2017, and your
amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act for BRIXADI (buprenorphine extended-release) injection for subcutaneous use, 8 mg, 16
ing, 24 mg, 32 mg weekly; 64 mg, 96 mg, 128 mg a monthly.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated December 14, 21 and 22 (2), 2017, and
January 4, 5, 9 (2), and 12, 2018, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate
applicable sections of these amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the
deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL/STATISTICAL

1. There are insufficient clinical data |

Information needed to resolve deficiency
Provide additional data ©® or withdraw it
from the application.

2. The submitted clinical datasets were found to include a number of discrepancies and.
errors, which you have determined were likely caused by limited QC/edit function checks
between the IVR database and the clinical database.

Reference ID: 4209438

NDA 210136
Page 2

Information needed to resolve deficiency
We acknowledge that you have resubmitted datasets which are intended to correct these
errors. The resubmitted data were not reviewed for this action.

In addition to the datasets, submit a document describing the nature of the errors.
Provide documentation of any auditing procedures performed to ensure that the datasets
are reliable and that all errors have been identified and addressed.

Further, there are incomplete responses to prior information requests. For example, the
response to the November 16, 2017, information request (IR) about Subject HS-11-421-
who appeared to have two doses of study drug on the first day of treatment,
noted that the subject received the SL BPN test doses and one dose of the 16 mg weekly
formulation. However, there was no explanation as to why the kits were administered at

the exact same time or whether any time elapsed from the test dose to the study dose.
Similarly, you noted that Subject HS-11-421- © did not receive a 32 mg dose on
Day 3 of the study, as the subject was in the SL BPN group. However, you did not
provide an explanation as to how that error occurred or what measures were taken to
ensure that the other data fields are accurate. Additionally, there were several subjects
identified as having distinct visits on the same day. Of these subjects, you reported HS-
11-421- © as a lab error and HS-11-4214 © as an oversight during data.

For each of the data errors identified in prior information requests, and for any further
errors identified in the corrected datasets, provide an explanation with relevant
documentation as to how these errors occurred and were corrected.

3. The Summary of Clinical Safety and the Clinical Study Report for Study HS-11-421 did
not include an evaluation of dose-response for either efficacy or safety, nor an analysis of
whether any dose-related risks were balanced by incremental increases in efficacy.
Responses to our information requests during the review cycle were limited to tabulations
without comments or conclusions.

Information needed to resolve deficiency

Provide a revised Summary of Clinical Safety and Summary of Clinical Efficacy that
includes analysis and discussion of the dose-response relationships and how they inform
the overall balance of risk and benefit.

4. The adverse event datasets (HS-11-421) lacked some relevant data fields. A response to
an information request resolved only some of the issues. The dataset lacked variables
necessary to identify patterns between adverse events and actions taken (e.g., dose
increased and drug interrupted) and the dose a patient was taking when the adverse event
occurred. Additionally, 35 entries of adverse events were not listed by dose or
formulation in the dataset.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
We acknowledge that you have resubmitted datasets which are intended to correct
discrepancies in the datasets and the resubmitted data will be reviewed in the next review

cycle. However, for the safety datasets (ie., ADSL and ADAE) specifically, ensure that
the following variables are included: ORALDAY; ORALDOSE; INJECTIONDAY;
INJECTIONDOSE; INJECTION FORM; LASTFULL EXPOSURE. Create a flag that
indicates if a patient received a supplemental dose of CAM2038. Note that, as
discrepancies or missing data are identified in the patient populations, narratives
describing the nature of these findings should be generated and submitted.

5. Regarding financial disclosures, descriptions of the steps taken to minimize bias were not
provided for the clinical investigators that received large honoraria.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
Provide descriptions of the steps taken to minimize bias of the site investigators who
received any large honoraria for Studies HS-11-421, HS-13-478, and HS-14-499.

NONCLINICAL

6. You have not provided adequate extractables studies to fully characterize the potential
leachables profile of the proposed container closure system. Specifically, the studies
submitted with the NDA did not employ sufficiently exhaustive conditions!

We acknowledge
that your TTCs were based on concepts outlined in ICH M7, and this guidance notes that
the acceptable daily intake for genotoxic impurities may be based on total number of
dosing days over a lifetime. However, your product is intended to provide continuous
exposure to the API for the duration of dosing. Due to the way in which the drug depot is
intended to form in subcutaneous tissue after drug administration, leachables arising from
the container closure system are likely to be incorporated into the depot ba

why Consequently, patients may be exposed to leachables over the
same duration the API is released; at least 7 days and 28 days for the weekly and monthly
formulations, respectively. Moreover, treatment for opioid abuse disorder may exceed 10
years. Therefore, your AETs must be able to detect any compound that could be exposed
at 1.5 meg/day or greater. We acknowledge that you have initiated new extractables
studies to address these concerns. However, these new data were not provided in time for
review for this action.

Information needed to resolve deficiency

Submit final study reports for extraction studies testing
y employing rigorous extraction techniques in accordance with

USP <1663>: Assessment of Extractables Associated with Pharmaceutical

Packaging/Delivery Systems and ensure that your analytical methods are capable of

detecting any compound over 1.5 mcg/day. Use these data to inform which compounds

are to be monitored in the leachables studies.

4)

Reference ID: 4209438

NDA 210136

7. You have not provided an adequate leachables evaluation to justify the safety of the
proposed container closure system. Specifically, your leachables evaluation did not
evaluate at least three batches of your to-be-marketed drug product for leachables and
include assessments at multiple timepoints over the course of your stability studies as
advised at the March 16, 2017, Pre-NDA meeting, and in accordance with best practices
per USP <1664>: Assessment of Drug Product Leachables Associated with
Pharmaceutical Packaging/Delivery Systems.

Information needed to resolve deficiency

Conduct a new leachables study that evaluates at least three batches of the to-be-
marketed weekly and monthly drug products and include assessments at multiple
timepoints over the course of stability studies (beginning, middle, and end of proposed
shelf-life) in order to identify trends in leachable levels over time. In the materials tested,
include any secondary container closure systems, if present, and subject these materials to
the same sterilization methods, as appropriate. Use the results of the extraction studies to
assure that you are adequately monitoring the drug product stability samples for potential
leachables from the primary or secondary container closure systems and from your
analysis of data from any upstream manufacturing processes that suggest the potential for
additional leachable compounds in the final drug product formulation. For all drug
products, establish the AET to be able to detect any compound that could be present at
1.5 meg/day or greater. If you cannot meet these thresholds, safety evaluations should be
based on the limits of quantitation (LOQ). In your assessment, include a table listing all
compounds, including the concentration in ppm, the experimental conditions, and the
maximum daily exposure to these compounds based on the maximum daily dose of the
product. Provide a toxicological risk assessment that qualifies any leachable detected at
or greater than 1.5 mcg/day from a genotoxicity perspective and any leachable detected at
or greater than 5 mcg/day from a general toxicity perspective. Include copies of all
referenced studies upon which a safety assessment is based. We acknowledge that you
initiated new leachables studies during this review cycle; however, these new data were
not provided in time for review for this action. Submit final study reports for leachables
studies that take into consideration the comments outlined above with your resubmission.

8. You have not provided adequate pharmacokinetic data to appropriately calculate
exposure margins for buprenorphine in your labeling. Although you have provided
AUCo.24n data in animals, you have only provided human AUC,, data. The exposure
margins based on AUC in the labeling are to be based on the worst-case exposures in
humans over the treatment period at steady state.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
Provide mean partial AUC (24-hour interval) data in humans at steady state that
represents the highest exposures over any given 24-hour period to inform labeling.

9. You have not provided adequate justification that the cited published data on the
reproductive and developmental effects of NMP adequately address all standard
toxicological endpoints for reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. Further, you
have not provided adequate data to bridge the published and unpublished studies which

Reference ID: 4209438

NDA 210136
Page 5

employed routes other than the proposed clinical route. Although the data suggest some
degree of safety following the different routes of administration, lack of adequate
toxicokinetic data and inclusion of all standard endpoints in these studies preclude
definitive conclusions regarding the potential risk of NMP via your drug product on these
endpoints.

Information needed to resolve deficiency

Conduct definitive reproductive and developmental studies with NMP administered via
the SC route. Alternatively, provide adequate PK bridging studies to the existing studies
and clearly delineate how the referenced studies address all standard endpoints for
fertility and early embryonic development, embryofetal development in two species, and
pre- and postnatal development. Draft unpublished study reports are not acceptable as
they may not reflect the final presentation of the data. Should you elect to conduct
bridging studies, your resubmission must also include a discussion regarding the impact
of the safety margins for reported effects of NMP given the known risks to these
endpoints from buprenorphine.

10. You have not provided an adequate scientific bridge to the referenced published studies
testing diacylglycerol oil (DAG) as a surrogate chemical solution for glycerol dioleate
(GDO) for the effects of this novel excipient on rat fertility and early embryonic
development, rat embryofetal development, rodent general toxicity, or rat and mouse
carcinogenicity.

Information needed to resolve deficiency

As discussed at the February 24, 2015, End-of-Phase 2 meeting, provide data to support
your conclusion that the DAG oil tested in these publications contains GDO at levels
which provide an adequate characterization of the effects of GDO on these required
studies.

11. You have not provided a rabbit embryo-fetal development study for the new excipient
GbDO.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
Either conduct an EFD study in the rabbit testing GDO or provide adequate justification
why a study is not necessary.

12. You have not provided adequate justification for your conclusion that there is no
carcinogenic potential of NMP even though your toxicological risk assessment of NMP
noted hepatic tumors in mice.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
Conduct a mode of action assessment for N-methyl-pyrrolidone-induced mouse
hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas to inform the human risk assessment for NMP.

INDICATION AND USAGE

You proposed the following indication statement:
Oo)

Modify the language to clearly identify the different uses of the Weekly and Monthly
Products, and to limit use to treating moderate to severe opioid use disorder.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Reorganize the proposed labeling to clearly identify the uses of the Weekly and
Monthly Products and the approach to dose conversion. The starting dose should be
revised from the proposed! weekly at the first injection to the regimen studied
in the clinical trials (16 mg weekly, followed by additional 8 mg weekly at
subsequent visits later the same week).

The recommended injection sites should be limited to the abdomen, buttock, and
thigh because the arm site did not yield BE results.

RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY REQUIREMENTS

Section 505-1 of the FDCA authorizes FDA to require the submission of a risk evaluation
and mitigation strategy (REMS) if FDA determines that such a strategy is necessary to ensure
that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks [section 505-1(a)].

We acknowledge receipt of your proposed REMS on October 10, 2017, which contains a
Medication Guide, elements to assure safe use (ETASU), an implementation system and a
timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS.

In accordance with section 505-1 of the FDCA, we have determined that a REMS is
necessary for BRIXADI, if it is approved, to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the
risk(s) of serious harm or death that could result from intravenous (IV) self-administration.
The REMS must include the following ETASU: healthcare settings and pharmacies that
dispense BRIXADI must be certified. The REMS must also include an implementation
system and a timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS.

The REMS, should it be approved, will create enforceable obligations. We will continue
discussion of your proposed REMS after your complete response to this action letter has
been submitted.

SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at

21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and
clinical studies/trials of the product under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or
dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious
adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:

e Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication
using the same format as in the original submission.

e Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application
data.

e Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application
with the retabulated frequencies described in the bullet above.

e For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the
frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

Reference ID: 4209438

NDA 210136
Page 14

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating
the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns
identified.

4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a
clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition,
provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common,
ut less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.

6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of
subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product. Include an
updated estimate of use for product marketed in other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously
submitted.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

Carton and container labeling

a. Reference is made to your draft labeling submission dated November 30, 2017. You are
proposing to market professional samples for each weekly and monthly strength of
buprenorphine extended-release injection. Submit container label and carton label mock-
ups for each professional sample for Agency review.

b. Ensure the lot number and expiration date is included on the final syringe labels and
cartons for each buprenorphine weekly and monthly injection per 21 CFR 201.10(i)(1)
and 21 CFR 201.17. Additionally, we note the inclusion of an additional “Rx Only”
statement shown above the NDC number on the buprenorphine 8 mg syringe label, which
should be removed.

c. We note the unit of measurement (i.e. °C and °F) does not follow each numerical value of
the temperature range within the storage statement on each carton. The acceptable
storage temperature could be misinterpreted and pose risk of improper storage leading to
decrease product quality. To provide clarity, we recommend revising the temperature
statement on each carton to read: Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); with excursions
permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F and 86°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].

Reference ID: 4209438

NDA 210136
Page 15

d. We acknowledge the revision to the product code of each NDC; however, we note the
NDC package code (last 2 digits) for the buprenorphine weekly and monthly strengths 16
mg/0.32 mL and higher does not correspond to the package size. Each carton contains
one unit of use, as such, the NDC package code typically aligns with the package size.
We recommend you consider revising the NDC number on each syringe label and carton
so the package code reflects “01” as the package size (e.g. revise to 58284-016-01,
58284-064-01, etc.). Additionally, ensure the NDCs are updated in the prescribing
information accordingly.

OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions
available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your
lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also
request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly
marked with ""RESUBMISSION"" in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter
of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a
complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will
not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take
before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your

CLINICAL/STATISTICAL

1) In addition to and independent of the deficiencies related to the lack of an
adequate scientific bridge described in Biopharmaceutics comment #1 above,
your Phase 3 trial (Study Mapi GA Depot Phase III — 001) did not provide
interpretable or persuasive findings of efficacy for GA Depot as a treatment for
relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), and therefore does not meet the
evidentiary standard for substantial evidence of effectiveness when considered
independent of the failure to establish the scientific bridge to Copaxone

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 5343048

NDA 218223
Page 19

necessary for reliance on findings of safety and effectiveness of Copaxone in the
context of a 505(b)(2) NDA.

Though the Phase 3 study achieved a statistically significant finding in its primary
efficacy endpoint, there are substantial concerns regarding the quality and
integrity of relapse data upon which the primary endpoint was based, many of
which were conveyed in the Study May Proceed Letter for OO dated

. These concerns would need to be addressed in a new
adequate and well-controlled study demonstrating a significant treatment effect
on a rigorously measured primary outcome. We strongly recommend that you
seek the Division’s feedback on any protocol for a future study intended to
provide substantial evidence of effectiveness.

The reasons for our determination that the primary efficacy outcome data are not
interpretable are as follows:

a) The multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse determination methodology was not
acceptable for a primary efficacy outcome measure.

i) The Phase 3 study protocol and other materials submitted with your NDA
did not include documentation of the process used for relapse
confirmation. Only investigator-determined (i.e., protocol-defined and non-
protocol-defined), not suspected, relapses were recorded, as you
confirmed in your ow , response to IR. As stated in the Study
May Proceed Letterfor © |, dated Cy , “there should
be a process for documentation of the disposition of all potential relapses
including the dates of the initial clinical assessment and all related
assessments, identification of the assessor(s), and a final determination of
whether the event was considered a relapse... This entire process should
be auditable.”

Therefore, the Division was unable to audit the process you utilized for
relapse evaluation and could not determine how relapses were confirmed.
Because of the lack of accounting of suspected or unconfirmed relapses,
we cannot conduct sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of your
relapse outcome. Due to an inability to determine how relapses were
defined and confirmed, we cannot consider your primary efficacy outcome
to be interpretable.

ii) The window for subject evaluation for potential relapse assessment
following symptom onset (2 weeks) was unacceptably prolonged. As
stated in the Study May Proceed Letter for dated

, ‘all subject reports of a possible relapse should be assessed within
no more than 48 hours of receipt by the site staff. All related assessments
should be completed within no more than 72 hours.” A duration of 2 weeks

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 5343048

NDA 218223
Page 20

c)

between symptom onset and relapse assessment could potentially lead to
recall bias by the subject. A delay in relapse assessment could also yield
an uninterpretable Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score if the
subject had an examination that took place after spontaneous recovery
had occurred or a subject was treated prior to the Treating Investigator’s
assessment. Our analysis indicates that 25% of subjects in the GA Depot
and placebo groups who had investigator-determined relapses (as
identified in the ADPRIM dataset) were evaluated by the Treating
Investigator more than 48 hours after symptoms were reported, with a
maximum time to evaluation of 11 days.

The Treating Investigator was not blinded to the EDSS rater’s
assessments, which was a potential source of a systematic confirmation
bias. Though we acknowledge that, per the protocol, disclosure of the
EDSS score to the Treating Investigator was necessary to determine
whether a relapse was protocol-defined, this disclosure is not an
acceptable approach in clinical trial relapse assessment. The Treating
Investigator and EDSS rater should be blinded to each other’s
assessments for integrity and interpretability of efficacy data.

iv) The protocol did not include an independent Relapse Adjudication
Committee. Though an independent assessment is not a requirement for
an adequate and well-controlled study, inclusion of an independent
Relapse Adjudication Committee is strongly recommended to increase the
objectivity of the relapse determination process when there is ambiguity in
a per-protocol relapse assessment. Therefore, in the setting of the other
concerns enumerated in this letter, the lack of such a committee in your
trial means there is no objective verification of protocol-defined relapses
and results in the inability to resolve the deficiencies in the relapse
determination process identified during review.

v) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was not included as a standard
component of the relapse evaluation, which also raises concerns over the
adequacy of the relapse evaluation and relapse definition processes. MRI
evaluation is considered standard of care for MS relapse assessment and
is an objective means of verifying relapse occurrence.

The high number of major protocol deviations pertaining to missed study drug
doses reported in Study Mapi GA Depot Phase III — 001, although generally
balanced between the groups, is concerning and further limits study
interpretability, particularly in the setting of an assessment of a monthly depot
injection.

Data were not collected after treatment discontinuation, which could have
provided necessary context for interpreting the primary efficacy outcome data.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 5343048

NDA 218223

Page 21

Since the reason for study discontinuation may be related to the treatment
assignment (i.e., perceived lack of efficacy or an adverse event) or the
primary endpoint (i.e., a relapse), the loss of these data may lead to bias in
the estimated treatment effect. Collection of post-discontinuation efficacy (in
addition to safety) data via a final study visit is an expectation in an adequate
and well-controlled clinical trial.

During the review of this application, the Division noted errors in datasets and
the Clinical Study Report, which were acknowledged via IRs. In the setting of
the interpretability concerns due to the relapse evaluation and definition
process discussed in Clinical/Statistical comment #1a, the noted errors and
omissions in your application raised concerns regarding the quality and
reliability of all the data submitted in support of this application. The IR
responses you provided in some cases could not provide necessary clarity
regarding the apparently erroneous data. Examples of such irreconcilable
errors include, but are not limited to, the following:

i)

ili)

There was an error in the study period end date (Last Patient Last Visit) in
the Clinical Study Report. Your response to IR received on om

ated that “June 17 was a typo; as per the data collected it should
have ‘been June 15, 2022.”

a

We were unable to replicate the study period end date with the data
submitted. Your response to IR received on om , did not
adequately explain the definition of the date of treatment completion
submitted with the study data and its relation to the study period end date
from the Clinical Study Report.

Several issues related to coding of protocol deviations for Study Mapi GA
Depot Phase II! — 001 were identified during this review cycle. Despite IRs
sent on , the coding of
deviations and subject numbers you provided in summary tables and line
listings submitted in response to these IRs remained inconsistent with
those included in the ADDV dataset.

In your response to IR received on oe , you stated that you
discovered that 2 different guidances were used to code and evaluate
protocol deviations in the dataset included with the original NDA
submission. It remains unclear whether the protocol deviations that were
reported represent an accurate account of all deviations that occurred.

2) In addition to the data quality and interpretability issues discussed in
Clinical/Statistical comment #1, the secondary MRI-related endpoints yielded
discordant results regarding a potential treatment effect of GA Depot, both within

electrocardiogram (ECG) data were also considered inadequate.

Study Mapi GA Depot Phase II! — 001, the Phase 3 study intended to
demonstrate similarity of the safety profile between GA Depot and Copaxone,
raised new safety concerns for GA Depot and suggested important differences in
the safety profiles of GA Depot and Copaxone. Particularly in the absence of an
adequate scientific bridge, the observed differences in the safety profile of GA
Depot and that of the listed drug are concerning for important differences
between the products that would further preclude a reliance on the listed drug for

a) Treatment with GA Depot was associated with severe injection site reactions,
including injection site abscess. Though injection site abscess is reported as
an infrequent adverse reaction (i.e., occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients) in
current approved labeling for Copaxone, the frequency of injection site
abscesses in Study Mapi GA Depot Phase III — 001 (estimated via Division

Combination Product

Combination products are subject to the CGMP requirements applicable to each
constituent part (drug, device, biological product) of the combination product. However,
as reflected in the final rule on CGMPs for combination products (21 CFR part 4),
manufacturers have the option to demonstrate compliance both with the drug CGMP
regulations (21 CFR parts 210 and 211) and with the device quality system (QS)
regulation (i.e., 21 CFR part 820) through a streamlined approach. In addition, for
combination products that include a biological product constituent part, manufacturers
must demonstrate compliance with the CGMP requirements specific to biological
products in 21 CFR parts 600 through 680.

If utilizing a streamlined approach, you must demonstrate compliance (i) with either the
drug CGMP regulations or the QS regulation in their entirety and also (ii) with those
provisions specified in part 4 from the other of these two sets of requirements.

$ When final, this guidance will represent the FDA’s current thinking on this topic. For the most recent
version of a guidance, check the FDA guidance web page at

Alternatively, you may demonstrate compliance with both the drug CGMPs and QS
regulation in their entirety (non-streamlined approach). For further information on
21 CFR part 4, see the guidance for industry and FDA staff Current Good
Manufacturing Practice Requirements for Combination Products (January 2017).

We acknowledge that your application includes information intending to demonstrate
compliance with the device QS regulation. However, this information has not been
reviewed at this time because, based on an assessment of the risk profile of your
proposed combination product, FDA has determined that information to demonstrate
compliance with the device QS regulation is most appropriately assessed during
inspection rather than reviewed as part of the quality assessment of your application.
Therefore, this information must be available upon inspection, and assessment of this
information has been deferred for possible review during inspection to demonstrate your
compliance with 21 CFR part 4. Ensure that the information you have available on-site
describes how your firm has implemented each applicable regulation in your
manufacturing processes, and that it includes descriptions of the specific procedures
and activities conducted by your firm and the protocols used by your firm for each
activity.

OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other
actions available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we
may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under

21 CFR 314.65. You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the
application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be
clearly marked with ""RESUBMISSION"" in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the
cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider
this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial
response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new
review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to
take before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting,
submit your meeting request as described in the draft guidance for industry Formal

COMPLETE RESPONSE

Agile Therapeutics, Inc.

Attention: Marie Foegh, M.D., Dr. Sc.

Chief Medical Officer & Vice President, Clinical and Research & Development
101 Poor Farm Road

Princeton, NJ 08540

Dear Dr. Foegh:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated April 12, 2012, received April 13,
2012, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for
Twirla (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol) transdermal system for the prevention of pregnancy
in women who elect to use a transdermal system as a method of contraception.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 19, June 1, July 10, 16, and 18, August
3, 10, 15, 16, and 31, October 17, 19, and 31, November 29, December 4 and 12, 2012; January
11, 16, 17, 18, and 29, 2013.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL

1. The two phase 3 studies submitted in this NDA failed to demonstrate acceptable evidence of
efficacy. The Pearl Index in the larger 13-cycle study (ATI-CL12) was 7.50 with an upper
bound of the 95% confidence interval of 9.97. The Pearl Index in the smaller 6-cycle study
(ATI-CL13) was 8.19 with an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of 16.19. Our
calculations are based on pregnancies identified as on-treatment. These Pearl Indices and the
upper bounds of their associated 95% confidence intervals are substantially higher than that
seen in the registration trials for any of the approved hormonal contraceptives. You attribute
these findings to inclusion of subjects in your trials who are more representative of women in
the United States who would use the product, if approved. We encourage and value clinical
trials that include generalizable populations. However, several of your assertions with regard
to generalizability are not supported by the available data. In addition, we have identified
substantial problems with study conduct, including low completion rates and issues with
subject follow-up and data collection that limit conclusions and our confidence in the study
results. We also have no evidence that your product will have a better safety profile than
other combination hormonal contraceptives to justify accepting the higher Pearl Indices.

Reference ID: 3261324

NDA 204017
Page 2

In order to address this deficiency, you will need to conduct a new pre-approval phase 3
study in a representative sample of women in the United States who are seeking hormonal
contraception. This study will need to demonstrate an acceptable Pearl Index and upper
bound of the 95% confidence interval. We recommend that the study duration be 13 cycles.
The study should use your proposed to-be-marketed product after you have adequately
addressed the product quality deficiencies (see below) that may have impacted the efficacy
findings in your completed studies. We also recommend that you conduct further analyses of
Study ATI-CL12 to identify possible explanations for some of the observed findings, such as
the clustering of pregnancies at five clinic sites, the impact of incentives for subjects to
remain in the study, and the adequacy of investigator training. These exploratory analyses
will not be sufficient to address our concerns but may yield useful information that can be
incorporated into the design of your new study.

The new study should be conducted with rigor and close oversight to ensure that the
following issues identified in the current submission are minimized or addressed in a timely

manner:

High rates of premature withdrawal from the study and loss to follow-up
Subject non-compliance with drug use, study visits and study procedures such as
daily diary completion, sonograms to date pregnancies, and providing accurate
follow-up contact information.

Fairly high number of cycles excluded from the efficacy analysis because no
intercourse occurred or in which back-up contraception was used

Missing data, conflicting data, illegible data, and poor follow-up, which made it
difficult to accurately determine the date of conception and the date of last patch use
in many of the pregnancies

Discrepancies in reporting of serious adverse events and lack of adequate
information about diagnostic workups, which made it difficult to make a meaningful
determination as to whether the event might have been drug-related.

Subject concerns about patch adhesion, application site reactions and acceptability
of the patch

Investigator inexperience with the conduct of contraceptive studies

Rapid study enrollment, which may have contributed to selection of many subjects
who were not committed to completing the trial or using study medication

¢ Rapid completion of the final study reports that may have resulted in a poor quality
submission containing numerous errors and inconsistencies

controls adequately control the etching process.

2. The specification is not adequate as presented in your submission. The current specification
provided in the NDA does not contain a test for cold flow or shear as requested and
discussed in our Information Request letters and your October 17, 2012, response.
Additionally, acceptance criteria for several tests are not adequate, have not been
adequately updated as previously requested, or have not been adequately justified. You
need to update the specification and acceptance criteria accordingly.

3. The justification for the specifications is not adequate. Justify the upper and lower bounds
of the acceptance criteria for the excipient assay with either in vivo or in vitro skin
permeation data. We acknowledge the additional information provided on October 17,
2012: (4)

Given the
importance of the permeation enhancers in drug delivery and the manufacturing and
stability variability potential discussed in your NDA and in your submission received
October 17, 2012, the bounds of the acceptance criteria cannot be adequately justified
based on statistical analyses. Further justification is needed.

4. Identify the strength of the product oo levonorgestrel and
© ethinyl estradiol (or equivalent presentation of language and units).
Additionally, the identifying label on the backing membrane of the drug product (each
patch) must, at a minimum, include the name of the product and the strength. This is
consistent with FDA’s current policy regarding the identifying label for all transdermal
drug delivery systems.
5. Impurities have not been adequately characterized. You need to test for 7
in the final product and provide acceptance criteria for these © (if toxicologically
relevant levels are detected in the final drug product) or justify why a test for CoG
is not needed.

6. Update the post-approval stability protocol with new tests added to the specification.

7. Your application referenced the Drug Master File (DMF) |). This DMF was found
inadequate to support your submission. An information request letter was sent to the DMF
holder on March 14, 2012. These deficiencies must be adequately addressed before this
application can be approved. As part of your response to this letter, include the date that
the DMF holder amended their DMF to address the deficiencies.

8. During the facility inspection, it was noted that different equipment was used for the
manufacture of clinical trial supplies as compared to that proposed for the commercial
product. Provide a tabulated comparison of the two proce and equipment. Address
whether the new equipment is of a different design or operating principle. If it is a scale-up
of the equipment, address whether this can change the product performance. Also, you are
proposing a new laser etching process to be used for the identifying label on the
commercial product. The impact of the etch was not assessed during clinical trials. In

Reference ID: 3261324

NDA 204017
Page 4

order to support this change, provide data to demonstrate that the new process will not
adversely impact the performance of the product. At a minimum, include comparative
performance (in vitro or in vivo) data and stability data to support the proposed shelf life.
Validation studies will need to be conducted on the new equipment. Inspection requests
may be resubmitted upon receipt of your Complete Response submission.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
The following comments are not approvability issues, but should be addressed in the Complete
Response submission.

Clinical

1.

Ensure that a future study enrolls a sufficiently large and diverse population from the
United States so that efficacy can be assessed in the following subgroups, for which the
current submission suggests possible discrepancies in efficacy:

a. Racial/ethnic subgroups (White, African-American, Hispanic)

b. Subjects categorized by site of patch application (buttock, abdomen, upper torso)
We do not require that you include an active comparator in the future study.

We do not require you to assess drug levels in an attempt to measure drug compliance.
However, if you choose to do so, this information may be useful to investigators in
counseling subjects who do not appear to be using the product correctly.

Enroll a sufficient number of women who are truly naive users of hormonal
contraception, and provide clear and accurate data on previous use that allows naive users
(never before used hormonal contraception) to be distinguished from prior users who
have not used hormonal contraception within a specified time period before their
enrollment.

Should a sizeable percent of women with possible pregnancy and/or adverse events be
lost-to-follow-up, this would be a significant review issue. Similarly, “false positive”
HCG results are expected to be rare and should be further evaluated (e.g., confirmation
by a urine pregnancy test, repeat quantitative serum testing, and ultrasound
examinations). Should there be a number of such cases, particularly where further
follow-up was not done, this would be a significant review issue.

Discrepancies between the Investigator and Sponsor interpretations of a pregnancy
should be carefully delineated.

In your new study, a better scoring system for patch adherence should be devised and
data should not be dependent on only observation at site visits; data about patch
adherence should also be recorded in the subject diary, as it is likely to provide data that
is more accurate and representative of the entire treatment period.

Reference ID: 3261324

NDA 204017
Page 5

8. For your new study, we request that the study report adhere to the Mishell et al.
recommendations (Contraception, 2007, 75: 4-15) for the primary analysis of the
bleeding profile, rather than using an 84-day reference period. For the various
parameters of bleeding and/or spotting, provide the mean, median, and range of observed
days of bleeding, spotting, and bleeding plus spotting within each 28-day reference
period.

9. In your new study, provide summary information on the outcome of all on-treatment
pregnancies, including neonatal condition in the case of live-born infants.

10. If you intend to rely on safety or efficacy data from Study ATI-CL12, conduct an external
audit of the data submitted in the final study report, and include the findings of the audit
in your Complete Response Submission.

Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls
1. You provided an assessment of skin adhesion characteristics in the October 17, 2012,
submission entitled “Summary of Reasons for Unscheduled Patch Change by Subject Self-
ment Safety Population” (Clinical/Statistical Report: Table 14.3.7_4.1). Amend this
ment to include “Partly Detached” and “‘Accidently Pulled Off.”

e The categories “Patch Fall Off,” “Partly Detached” and “Accidently Pulled Off” are
all adhesive concerns that could result in inadequate delivery of therapy and should
be included in the adhesive assessment. When these categories are included, the
percent of transdermal systems experiencing adhesive issues range from 5.0-9.7%
with an average of 6.8%.

2. We conducted a Methods Validation of methods TP011 (Release Liner Peel Force), TP078
(Determination of Shear), TP074 (Part Adhesion), and AM79 (Excipient Determination)
and provide the following comments for your consideration in your Analytical Method
Development:

e Corium Test Procedure Determination of Shear Adhesion (Doc # TP078 Effective
NOV 30 2010 Rev 04 DCR # 10475) was not evaluated because the method stated to

Clinical Pharmacology:

1. Address whether the product quality deficiencies described above may have impacted the
findings in your clinical pharmacology studies. You may need to repeat some of your
clinical pharmacology studies if the existing data are unreliable due to product quality.

2. We identified potential carry-over effects of both ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel
between adjacent treatment cycles (in Study ATI-CL14) and adjacent periods (in Study
ATI-CLI15 and ATI-CL16). This may also impact reliability of the study results. If the
product quality deficiencies can be adequately addressed, provide a revised analysis that
corrects for/compensates for this potential carry-over effect. If you are unable to adequately
address carry-over with the available data, provide a proposal for how you will obtain
reliable clinical pharmacology data.

LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise adequate. If you
revise labeling, your response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(1)(1)()]
in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at

SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at

21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and
clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or
dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious
adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:

¢ Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication
using the same format as the original NDA submission.

¢ Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original NDA data.

Attention: Lynley Thinnes
Executive Director, Regulatory Affairs

Dear Ms. Thinnes:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received October 30, 2018,
submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA),
for Bupivacaine and Meloxicam Extended Release Solution 60 mg/1.8 mg, 200 mg/6 mg, 400
mg/12 mg.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve
this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and,
where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

PRODUCT QUALITY

1. The limited data provided on leachables in the drug product, |
© is not adequate to assure that the leachables
remain within permitted daily exposure limits through the end of shelf-life. |

is not sufficient to establish the safety of
leachables present in HTX-011.

Information needed to address this deficiency:

Provide test data for all potential leachables, identified through the various extraction
studies, monitored at release and at multiple timepoints during the stability testing of
HTX-011 batches using validated analytical methods. Further refer to the Additional
Nonclinical Comment 5 regarding study design considerations.

2. During a recent inspection of the © (FEI: ©®) manufacturing

facility for this application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the
representative of the facility.

your drug product. The levels in the product exceed the maximum potency listed in the
CDER Inactive Ingredient Database (IID) and are, therefore, considered novel.
Specifically, your NDA did not include any discussion of the impact of these two
excipients on the standard reproductive and developmental battery of studies.

Information needed to address this deficiency:

Submit adequate data to fully characterize the impact of the proposed doses of DMSO.

and triacetin on all endpoints normally characterized via the standard battery of
reproductive and developmental toxicology studies. Should you elect to address this via
literature, justify the adequacy of the literature based on current standard study protocols
and provide copies of all referenced literature. In the absence of adequate published data,
GLP nonclinical toxicology studies should be completed.

Your toxicological risk assessment for the excipient maleic acid, which exceeds the
maximum potency listing in the CDER Inactive Ingredients Database (IID), does not
address the potential impact of maleic acid on embryo-fetal development in a second
species (typically rabbit).

Information needed to address this deficiency:

Submit adequate justification for the safety of the proposed maximum daily dose of
maleic acid, specifically with respect to the effects of this compound on rabbit embryo-
fetal development.

You have not provided adequate data to qualify the proposed drug product degradant
©® which exceeds the ICH Q3B(R2) qualification threshold.

Information needed to address this deficiency:

Either tighten the drug product specification © to NMT""% or
provide adequate qualification in accordance with ICH Q3B(R2) as follows:

a. Complete a minimal genetic toxicology screen (two in vitro genetic toxicology
studies, e.g., one point mutation assay and one chromosome aberration assay)

a. You have not tested at least three drug product stability batches over the entire
course of the stability protocol (e.g., 0, 3, 6, 12 months) in order to identify trends
for leachables over the course of stability.

b. You have not tested your drug product, for extractable compounds detected above

addition, since Extractable Study 3 did not address non-volatile compounds, conduct new
leachable studies based on the non-volatile compounds identified in Extractable Studies 1
(RPT-701) and 2 (RPT-693). As you design these studies, note the following comments
intended to guide your efforts:

a.

Include at least three to-be-marketed drug product batches, each tested over the
entire course of the stability protocol (0, 3, 6, 12 months) to identify trends for
leachables over the course of stability. The three drug batches should be stored
in the planned commercial container closure.

Of note, you used a conservative SCT of OM meg presumably based on
genotoxic concerns. However, for acute products (duration of < 1 month) an
SCT of 120 mcg/day can be used for genetic toxicity assessment. However, for
general toxicity concerns, employ a SCT of 5 mcg/day in the leachable study.
The leachable study should use an AET that accurately reflects the potential total
daily intake of potential leachables from the drug product and how the product
will be dosed. For example, if multiple vials are to be used to deliver a dose, this
could affect the AET calculation. In addition, as you have proposed multiple
drug product packaging presentations, the AET and toxicological risk assessment
must be based on the worst-case clinical use of the product, which may result in
the use of more than one packaging configuration per procedure, unless
adequately justified otherwise.

Multiple compounds were not fully identified from your extraction/leachable
studies. This included the leachable identified in the final drug product samples
from Leachable Study 3 as ® Provide descriptions of the methods and

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

1.

Reference ID: 4426880

Although the current nonclinical data appear to support the safety of bupivacaine when
the product is dosed up to 300 mg, the data do not provide adequate coverage for the
maximum AUCp.24, via this drug product at your proposed maximum dose of 400 mg
bupivacaine. Because your drug product exposures above 300 mg of bupivacaine via this
drug product will exceed that of the referenced drug product, additional data will be
required to support any proposed dose above 300 mg bupivacaine.

The numbers given under “Maximum intended dose volume (mL)” in Table 2, in section
3.2.P.1 Description and Composition, are not in agreement with the theoretical volume
required for delivering labeled amount of each drug.

Provide revised Table 2 with the corrected theoretical dose volume (mL) required for

each dose strength, up to second decimal point (e.g., © ») in your
resubmission.

(b) (4)
Based on the fact and your

statement on sensitivity of viscosity of HTX-011 solution to temperature changes, we
recommend that you test for ‘dynamic viscosity’ of HTX-011 and ‘syringeability’ of
HTX-011 solutions stored at 15°C and 25°C temperatures and report the test results in the
resubmission. Syringeability studies on HTX-011 solution may be performed by
simulating the steps described in IFU for preparation and use of HTX-011 and recording

COMPLETE RESPONSE

Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Attention: Sonya A. Roeloffzen
Director, Global Regulatory Affairs
84 Waterford Drive

Marlborough, MA 01752

Dear Ms. Roeloffzen:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated March 29, 2018, received March 29,
2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act for Kynmobi (apomorphine) sublingual film 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, and
30 mg.

We have completed our review of this application, and have determined that we cannot approve
this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and,
where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

HUMAN FACTORS (HF)

As communicated to you in a November 21, 2018, Discipline Review (DR) letter, the human
factors (HF) validation study conducted for Kynmobi does not provide sufficient evidence to
demonstrate that the proposed product can be used safely and effectively by intended users for its
intended uses and use environments. Your HF study identified several use errors and close calls
that occurred on critical tasks. Additionally, you have not provided data to demonstrate that your
proposed mitigations are effective and do not introduce new use-related risks. Furthermore, your
HF study did not evaluate the final intend-to-market user interface, i.e., your proposed

© packaging. Thus, you have not provided sufficient data to demonstrate whether
the intended users can open and close the packaging.

We acknowledge your December 7, 2018, formal response to the DR letter, and note that your
response provided additional information and your plan to address the Agency’s concerns about
your human factors (HF) validation study results and the © packaging. We also
acknowledge that you have evaluated this product in the clinical environment. However, the
intend-to-market outer carton © packaging) was not part of the user interface
evaluated in the HF validation study. While we acknowledge your proposed plan to submit a
petition for exemption from the child-resistant (CR) packaging requirement post-approval |
© it is not clear whether such exemption will be granted.

Reference ID: 4383056

NDA 210875
Page 2

The specific deficiencies identified in your HF validation study include the following:

1. Your study results showed several use errors and close calls that occurred on critical
tasks. We note that you implemented revisions to the Instructions for Use (IFU) and film
pouch (container label) to address the use errors and close calls. However, you did not
validate the revisions to the user interface. Furthermore, our evaluation of the proposed
user interface, label and labeling identified areas of vulnerability that may lead to
medication errors, and we provided additional recommendations in our November 21,
2018, Discipline Review letter. We acknowledge that you have implemented our IFU,
container label, and carton labeling recommendations.

2. We note that the © nackaging requires a push-pull technique to open,
which may pose concerns for the intended user population (i.e., patients with Parkinson’s
disease) due to dexterity and motor impairments that occur in the OFF period. We also
note that Kynmobi is intended for the acute, intermittent treatment of “OFF” episodes
associated with Parkinson’s disease; therefore, delay in therapy (e.g., due to difficulty
opening the © packaging) would cause the user to remain in the OFF state.
We are concerned that if users experience difficulty opening or closing the Oey
packaging, they might remove the foil pouches from the packaging permanently or alter
the packaging to eliminate the child-resistant features, which may increase the risk of
secondary exposure. As the © packaging was not part of the user interface
evaluated in the HF validation study and the intended user population has clinical
manifestations that might impact interaction with the © packaging, we find
that the study results are not representative of real-world use.

A human factors validation study using the intend-to-market user interface (i.e., oe
packaging) is needed to demonstrate that the mitigations are effective and do not introduce new
risks. You should evaluate the use-related errors observed in the HF study, employ additional
mitigation strategies, and update your use-related risk analysis prior to conducting that study.

We recommend you submit your HF validation study protocol for feedback before commencing
your study. Note that submission of a protocol for review is not a requirement.

Analyses and Human Factors Submissions to Drug and Biologic Applications” for the content of
a human factors validation study protocol submission. The guidance is available online at

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND BIOPHARMACEUTICS

Complete Study CTH-203 and provide the final report for Study CTH-203, which is necessary to
justify the relevance of comparative data with your proposed product (Kynmobi) and Apo-go to
support the scientific appropriateness of reliance on FDA’s finding of safety for Apokyn. In
addition, clearly describe the data and information that supports the scientific bridge between
your proposed product (Kynmobi) and the listed drug relied upon (Apokyn), which may include
data and information supporting a bridge between Kynmobi and Apo-go and between Apokyn
and Apo-go.

SAFETY

You have not adequately characterized the oropharyngeal adverse events that were observed in
patients treated with Kynmobi. These events were reported under multiple terms, such as
oropharyngeal pain, oropharyngeal swelling, pharyngeal erythema, gingivitis, oral pain, lip
swelling, gingival edema, mouth edema, lip ulceration, oral mucosal erythema, stomatitis, mouth
ulceration, oral discomfort, oral hypoesthesia, mouth swelling, glossodynia, tongue discomfort,
lip blister, dysgeusia, angular cheilitis, oropharyngeal pain, leukoplakia oral, lip exfoliation, oral
mucosal blistering, agueusia, throat irritation, oral allergy syndrome, pharyngeal edema, soft
palate swelling, and others.

Taken together, and according to our analyses, oropharyngeal adverse events were reported in
over 25% of patients treated with Kynmobi in the maintenance phase of Study 300, compared to
4% of patients on placebo. Oropharyngeal adverse events were also commonly observed in
Study 301, and were a common reason for discontinuation in both studies.

Reference ID: 4383056

NDA 210875
Page 4

You will need to provide a comprehensive discussion and summary of oropharyngeal adverse
events with Kynmobi, including an expert review from a qualified dermatologist. For both Study
300 and Study 301, reexamine your safety database, and pool all related oropharyngeal adverse
events in appropriate clusters (e.g., oropharyngeal edema, pain, ulceration, hypoesthesia, etc.).
Identify the number of oropharyngeal adverse events, and the number of unique patients
reporting at least one of the adverse events in the cluster. Identify the number of discontinuations
in both studies for each of these events and each cluster of events. Provide analyses of these
events by severity. Present this information for each study phase (e.g., titration and
maintenance) and for all patients in the overall safety population. Present analyses of the time to
onset of the events after treatment initiation, evolution, time course, time to resolution after
treatment discontinuation, and relationship to the dose of Kynmobi. Present analyses of the
association between oropharyngeal adverse events and systemic hypersensitivity, including the
temporal relationship between oropharyngeal and systemic hypersensitivity events, if any.

Send all patients reporting new oropharyngeal adverse events in ongoing Study CTH-301 toa
qualified dermatologist, and obtain photographs of all relevant oral and skin abnormalities
associated with the event. Submit a copy of the dermatologist’s diagnosis, the investigator’s
assessment, a case summary and the photographs of the relevant abnormalities.

SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update as described at

21 CFR 314.50(d)(5)(vi)(b). The safety update should include data from all nonclinical and
clinical studies/trials of the drug under consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or
dose level.

1. Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile.

2. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse events, serious
adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new safety data as follows:

e Present new safety data from the studies/clinical trials for the proposed indication
using the same format as in the original submission.

e Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original application
data.

e Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original application
with the retabulated frequencies described in the bullet above.

e For indications other than the proposed indication, provide separate tables for the
frequencies of adverse events occurring in clinical trials.

3. Present a retabulation of the reasons for premature trial discontinuation by incorporating

the drop-outs from the newly completed trials. Describe any new trends or patterns
identified.

Reference ID: 4383056

NDA 210875

Page 5
4. Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died during a
clinical trial or who did not complete a trial because of an adverse event. In addition,
provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.
5. Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of common,
ut less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original application data.
6. Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies/trials (e.g., number of
subjects, person time).
7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this drug. Include an
updated estimate of use for drug marketed in other countries.
8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously
submitted.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

1.

Reference ID: 4383056

You will need to conduct in vitro studies to evaluate drug-drug interaction (DDI)
potential of the two major metabolites from Kynmobi, apomorphine glucuronide and
norapomorphine glucuronide.

For the ISS, submit a new set of ADaM datasets that are fully compliant with the CDISC
standard. For example, the USUBJID should be uniform throughout the submitted data,
with every patient in the development program having the same unique identifier in every
dataset. The datasets should include all patients in the safety population from initiation of
clinical studies through an appropriate cut-off date for your re-submission.

The Summary of Clinical Safety should be updated with attention to all adverse events of
special interest, especially those suggesting hypersensitivity reactions. Perform an
analysis by dose and duration of exposure until the time of AE development in cases
identified by MedDRA SMQ for hypersensitivity and angioedema.

In addition to updating the analysis of exposure by total daily dose, perform an analysis
of exposure to APL-130277 for Studies 300 and 301 using self-reported daily frequency
of administration by patients.

For open-label Study CTH-301, submit the complete report or an interim report, if the
study is still ongoing at the time of resubmission.

In the 120-Day Safety Update, the EXDOSFRQ (Dosing Frequency per Interval) column
in the ADEX dataset is blank. Please provide this information in the amended datasets,
using the information from the patient dosing diaries prior to each visit. List the doses


NDA 210875
Page 6

taken per day as 0 through 5. Add a DOSEON column to show the dose prescribed for
the patient for each interval and another column showing the number of daily diaries
returned for the interval (e.g., 0, 1 or 2).

OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other actions
available under 21 CFR 314.110. If you do not take one of these actions, we may consider your
lack of response a request to withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. You may also
request an extension of time in which to resubmit the application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be clearly
marked with ""RESUBMISSION"" in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the cover letter
of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider this resubmission a
complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial response to this letter will
not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new review cycle.

You may request a meeting or teleconference with us to discuss what steps you need to take
before the application may be approved. If you wish to have such a meeting, submit your
meeting request as described in the draft FDA Guidance for Industry, “Formal Meetings
Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products,” December 2017 at

Cyclomedica Australia Pty Ltd.
Attention: Karen Wolfe-Kerker,

Vice President, Regulatory Affairs
Certus International, Inc

1422 Elbridge Payne Road, Ste 200
Chesterfield, MO 63017

Dear Ms. Wolfe-Kerker:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 26, 2020, received March
26, 2020 and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Technegas™ Technetium Tc-99m carbon aerosol.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated February 26, 2021, which
extended the goal date by three months to June 26, 2021.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

PRODUCT QUALITY

The Approvability Issues (deficiencies), with recommendations to address them, are as
follows:

A. Drug Substance and Drug Product

1. Characterization and control of the aerosol drug

In the current review cycle, the NDA has not provided adequate characterization
of the aerosol, including aerosol composition, batch formula, batch data, stability
data, identity, strength, purity, delivered dose, generator yield, generator duty
cycle and generator recertification period. You have not established aerosol
critical quality attributes and specifications to ensure the identity, strength,
quality, purity, or potency of the drug product under 21 CFR 314.50(d) (ii)((a)).
This includes attributes, methods and acceptance criteria.

Reference ID: 4817078

NDA 022335
Page 2

To address this issue, you must develop a quality program to characterize and
control your Technegas aerosol drug product. Validate your aerosol production
method at the highest and lowest end of the radioactivity range that you load to
the crucible and measure particle size distribution, radioactivity of the aerosol
and yield of the aerosol in this range. Propose and describe analytical methods
suitable for their intended purpose, with appropriate validation. Establish
specifications and justify acceptance criteria for the critical product quality
attributes based on data. Submit results from at least three production runs at the
minimum and maximum radioactivity load of your range.

2. Validation of the aerosol drug production and documentation

To address this issue, as outlined in Approvability Issue #1, provide aerosol
batch data from validated analytical methods for at least three registration
batches to support your commercial aerosol drug production and in-process
controls at the minimum and maximum crucible load of sodium pertechnetate
radioactivity. The batches must meet specifications and be produced according
to the proposed regulatory commercial production process under the in-process
controls using sodium pertechnetate injection solution supplied by the three
manufacturers approved in the United States (Technelite, Ultra-TechneKow and
Radiogenix). Revise your regulatory production description as advised in the
Discipline Review Letter sent December 7, 2020. As advised, implement the
following revisions: remove ’ include the volume and
strength of the sodium pertechnetate injection solution loaded in the crucible,
include the percent yield based on batch data produced at minimum and
maximum range of radioactivity loaded in the crucible and remove the sta ‘ement,

3. Analytical methods to characterize the aerosol particle size distribution,
radioactivity and the aerosol yield

To address this issue, as outlined in Approvability Issue #1, develop validated
analytical methods which are suitable to characterize the aerosol drug particle
size distribution, radioactivity and the aerosol yield. Due to the short expiry (10
minutes) and radioactivity of the aerosol, standard analytical methods for
pharmaceutical aerosols may not be suitable for this product. Consequently,
analytical methods may need to be developed for drug product quality, such as
those described in literature. For example, Jérémie Pourchez etal, Generation
and characterization of radiolabeled nanosized carbonaceous aerosols for
human inhalation studies, Journal of Aerosol Science, Elsevier,2013,55, pp.1-11.
10.1016/j.jaerosci. 2012.07.011. For each method, submit the analytical method
description and the method validation. We recommend you partner with
radiopharmaceutical drug development experts to develop and validate your new
methods and to submit the necessary documentation to the NDA to meet
requirements of drug regulations.

4. Control of a Critical Component of the Radioactive Drug Substance
(Crucible)

In the current review cycle, the NDA has not provided adequate specifications for
the crucible, on release or stability. Batch data, stability data and a post-approval
stability protocol for the crucibles have been agreed upon but not provided. To
address this issue, develop a quality program to characterize and control your
crucible, which is a critical component of the radioactive drug substance. Revise
your crucible specifications as advised, submit crucible release and stability data
which meet specifications, and submit a stability protocol for the crucible.

. PROCESS:

5. Environmental Controls

Your current environmental controls within the crucible manufacturing suite are
inadequate. The crucible manufacturing process

(b) (4)

to assure crucible product quality. We recommend a minimum of
environmental controls be established and monitored with
prior to packaging to meet the requirements of 21 CFR Part
211.46.

6. Inadequate manufacturing control strategy for © Crucible:

In the current review cycle, the NDA has not established adequate controls at
each stage of the crucible manufacturing process related to validated operating
parameters, in-process controls to support critical quality attributes. Additionally,
there are gaps with regards to raw data generation, storage and documentation
of regulated data using © for manufacturing of

™® Crucible.

To address this issue, please consider the following:

7. Shipping

We acknowledge the ISTA study protocol and test reports submitted
on1/7/2021 for the crucible shipping studies; however, you have failed to
address the adverse test observations noted for the tests. You have failed to
propose corrective actions or any proposed design changes for the primary or
secondary packaging to address the deficiencies for the © crucibles.
Provide updated test reports, address test observations, detailed corrective
actions with any proposed packaging design changes for primary and
secondary packaging for review and approval. Any packaging change will
require a new shipping study.

8. Production

We acknowledge the constraints of conducting functional tests for the final drug
product with each device release; however, you have failed to demonstrate
consistent and reliable production of the Tcm-99 carbon aerosol under good
manufacturing conditions and documented registration batches to comply with
the requirements of actual yield and % of theoretical yield as required by 21 CFR
Part 211.103 applicable for the Technegas System. Additionally, this a
requirement under 21 CFR Part 4 if adopting the streamlined approach and
implementing 21 CFR Part 820 regulations as the quality system.

9. Reliability Assessment

Your reliability assessment report for the Technegas™ system (val-003) is not
acceptable since it is not based on an approved protocol /verification test but
exclusively on customers complaints data gathered by the firm. Submit the
verification protocol, analytical tests/ methods, specifications and acceptance
criteria and final report for review and approval.

10. Yield

We acknowledge frm-0077 Technegas™ maintenance and repair check list and
the mnI-004 us tp preventive maintenance instruction submitted on 2/26/2021

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993

Page 5

to be executed during annual recertification to meet requirements of functional
test for the device for tcm-99 carbon aerosol; however, the proposed
procedures do not address the concerns of on-going yield monitoring of the
final drug product by the Technegas™ system as approved in drug
specification.

. DEVICE:

11. Exposure Dose

Provide details on the calculations performed in determining exposure doses and
threshold values that were used in calculating margin of safety values for all
detected chemicals. This information can be provided in tabulated form for
instances where the same calculation was repeated, however, explanatory notes
should be provided to describe and justify the selection of specific values
including but not limited to measured analytical concentrations, exposure metrics
(e.g., assumed maximum breathing volumes), conversion factors, toxicity
threshold values, and uncertainty factors.

» CLINICAL

12. Risk of Dyspnea and Hypoxia

Raw data submitted from the CYC-009 study indicate that only 21% of
subjects inhaled Technegas without operator intervention to provide
supplemental oxygen or to interrupt Technegas flow for the subject to breath

room air. You have proposed that adult patients should be instructed to on

A clear upper time limit for Technegas administration and
instructions for the operator to provide room air and supplemental oxygen
before, during, and/or after Technegas administration are lacking in your
NDA. Also lacking is discussion of breathing instructions for optimal or near-
optimal risk mitigation and instructions for operators to monitor and prepare
for this risk. Therefore, you will need to include the following information in
your complete response:

a. For each patient breathing method:

i. Specify or estimate the proportion of CYC-009 subjects who used
this method alone or in specific mixture of methods

ii. Clarify the relationship to methods studied in other investigations,
including NDA022335\0001\m5\54-lit-ref\lloyd-1994-2.pdf and
NDA022335\0001\m5\54-lit-ref\james-1991c.pdf

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4817078

NDA 022335
Page 6

iii. Discuss data on relative advantages and disadvantages to the
patient for maximizing the likelihood of targeted biodistribution and
minimizing the risk of dyspnea and hypoxia

b. Add the information lacking in the current NDA to instructions for
prescribers and device operators and add or re-prioritize patient breathing
instructions based on analysis specified under Issue #3a.

13. Recommended Loading Range in Adults
Justify the same or a revised range for your recommended loading range of

sodium pertechnetate Tc 99m injection, USP, accounting for the
range, volume, and number of loadings actually administered in study CYC-
009. If gaps remain between studied and recommended use, provide a
discussion of operator and patient tradeoffs for justification of each gap. Also
note our recommendation to cover the to-be-marketed range of sodium
pertechnetate Tc 99m loadings from minimum to maximum when conducting
new CMC investigation under CMC Issue #1.

14.Recommended Loading Range and Lung Count Rate In Pediatric
Patients 6 Years of Age and Older

Justify the same or a revised range for recommended lung count rate of 500
cps to 1000 cps and loading range 7

accounting for data on these parameters in actual use.
Provide range estimates with source information for the total number of
pediatric patients 6 years of age who have received Technegas in total in
both of the following populations:

a. Investigations reported in published literature.

b. Post-market experience where Technegas is marketed, either based on
marketing information available to you or on estimation from a surveyed
sample of Technegas administrators focused on pediatric patients.

Please note our recommendation to cover the to-be-marketed range of sodium
pertechnetate Tc 99m loadings from minimum to maximum when conducting new
CMC investigation under Product Quality Issue #1.

Attention: Herbert W. Hutman, M.D.
President

30 West Gude Drive, Suite 280
Rockville, Maryland 20850

Dear Dr. Hutman:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated August 31, 2021, received
August 31, 2021, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public
Health Service Act for (toripalimab-tpzi) injection.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 25, and April 28, 2022.
You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific reference as
part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

PRODUCT QUALITY
1. We have determined that manufacturing control strategy for toripalimab
manufacturing at © does not

align with current industry standards and ICH QS5A guidelines. Specifically, no
adventitious virus testing is performed for unprocessed bulks (UPBs) in the
manufacturing process to produce toripalimab and other product(s) for non-US
market. Those processes share common equipment and/or materials with
toripalimab manufacturing for the US market. ICH guideline Q5A Quality of
Biotechnological Products: Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products
Derived from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin recommends that
“Appropriate testing for viruses should be performed at the unprocessed bulk
level [...]” and “the safety of these products [biotechnology products derived from
cell lines] with regard to viral contamination can be reasonably assured only by
the application of a virus testing program and assessment of virus removal and
inactivation achieved by the manufacturing process [...]” through “testing the
product at appropriate steps of production for absence of contaminating
infectious viruses,” as well as requires “manufacturers develop programs for the

Reference ID: 4976394

BLA 761240
Page 2

ongoing assessment of adventitious viruses in production batches.” The lack of
an adventitious virus testing program for non-US manufacturing processes poses

a risk

of adventitious virus cross-contamination of toripalimab batches for the US

market manufactured using the same equipment and materials, as well as risk of
manufacturing facility disruptions that could risk patient supply.

To address the deficiency, provide the following information on control strategy
and measures implemented to assure that all toripalimab batches are produced
per current industry standards and aligned with ICH Q5A guidelines:

a.

You committed to implement virus testing for UPB for every batch of all
products which share equipment or materials or any other product-
contacting surface with toripalimab intended for the US market. Submit
change control report(s) demonstrating implementation of the virus testing
for UPB for all products manufactured on the same equipment as
toripalimab drug substance.

The materials and equipment used downstream of the UPB testing point
carry risk of being contaminated by unknown adventitious virus from
previously untested production batches. To mitigate this risk, implement
the following and submit applicable documentation demonstrating
implementation:

i. Replace the multi-use materials in manufacturing that harbor the
greatest risk of contamination, such as «
with new materials. Submit qualification and
implementation reports of these multi-use materials.

ii. Sterilize shared product-contact equipment that is amenable to
sterilization using methods sufficient for removal or inactivation of
viruses. Submit reports of the sterilization activities that assure a
virus-free process, including documentation of the method(s) used
and scientific justification for their suitability for removing or
inactivating virus.

Due to the risk of potential contamination of toripalimab batches produced
prior to the implementation of adequate viral safety measures, toripalimab
batches manufactured prior to implementation of these measures should
not be distributed for human use in the US. To fulfill 21 CFR 601.20(b)
requirements, confirm that toripalimab drug product produced from drug
substance manufactured after implementation of the corrective
measurements described in items a and b will be available within the
review timeline of the re-submitted application.

Dear Dr. Suarez:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated and received April 27,
2020, submitted under section 351(a) of the Public Health Service Act for tralokinumab
injection, 150 mg/ML.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

PRODUCT QUALITY

(1) You provided a response to an information request dated, December 14, 2020,

which provided documentation of ao
associated 510(k) references to address our

request for data verifying the needle safety performance of your combination
product at an appropriate reliability limit (95% confidence /99% reliability) and
pre-conditioning (aging, drop testing and shipping). While the testing provided
evidence for performance of the 510(k) cleared needle safety device component,
the testing did not include testing of your final finished combination product or
testing after the requested representative preconditioning (aging of the device,
dropping of the device, and simulated shipping). You also provided additional
information in your Late-Cycle background package dated January 22, 2021,
where you asserted that @ 3 510(k) FDA
cleared medical device that is manufactured ]

a) This device has been cleared by the FDA to provide protection from
accidental needle stick injury.

b) It has been commercially marketed worldwide since 2001 with numerous
products.

Reference ID: 4784685

BLA 761180
Page 2

c) Astudy evaluating the ©® device is summarized in the
attached document from” demonstrating 512 successful device safety
feature activation with 0 failures.

Needle safety performance needs to be tested on the final finished combination
product because the prefilled syringe, design differences between your final
finished combination product and currently marketed products, combination
product manufacturing and preconditioning would impact the performance and
reliability. Failure of the needle safety device to perform adequately may result in
serious risks (accidental contaminated needle sticks). Provide testing
demonstrating that your final finished combination product needle safety
performance (needle safety activation and lockout) can meet a confidence and
reliability of 95%/99% after aging of the device to the proposed shelf -life, drop
testing and simulated shipping per ASTM 4169-16 Standard Practice for
Performance Testing of Shipping Containers and Systems sequentially.

Dear Dr. Teuber:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated May 4, 2009, received May 4, 2009, submitted
under section 505(b)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Lucassin (terlipressin) injection,
1 mg.

We also refer to your submissions dated May 27, June 30, July 1 and 25, August 1, 8, 13, 20, September 5

30, September 2, 8, 22, 30, October 12, 13,15 and 16, 2009.

We have completed our review of your application, and have determined that we cannot approve this
application in its present form. We have described below our reasons for this action and, where possible,
our recommendations to address the issues.

CLINICAL/STATISTICAL

To support a claim for the treatment of patients with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type I, you submitted
two studies, OT-0401 (a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in HRS type I patients) and TAHRS (a
smaller, open-label, cross-over study in HRS type I and II patients). In OT-0401, terlipressin, compared
to placebo, appeared to show a modest reduction in serum creatinine, but the study failed to show
durability of effect. Using the prespecified primary endpoint and the original analytic plan, the results of
OT-401 were not statistically significant. Your most favorable analysis, using an endpoint developed
post-hoc with a generally unacceptable redefinition of treatment success, reaches statistical significance,
but comes nowhere close to the p-value necessary to support approval based upon a single study. The
smaller, open-label TAHRS also failed on its pre-specified primary endpoint and failed to show a
sustained effect on serum creatinine. In terms of support for the safety of the 14-day terlipressin regimen
proposed in labeling, your application includes experience in only 11 subjects in study OT-0401 and 9
subjects in TAHRS with exposure for 14 days. The extent of exposure is clearly insufficient to support
the safety of terlipressin for its intended use. Moreover, although the numbers of adverse events were
small, many important serious adverse events tended to occur more frequently, or earlier (i.e., death), in
terlipressin-treated subjects, compared to subjects in the respective control groups.

You will need to conduct at least one additional adequate and well-controlled study to demonstrate the
efficacy and safety of intravenous terlipressin for the treatment of HRS type I. This study will need to be
successful, using pre-specified endpoint(s) and analytic plan, at p<0.05. The Division is willing to meet
with you to discuss possible trial designs and endpoints that you might wish to consider as alternatives to
the endpoint pre-specified in OT-0401, as well as the extent of safety data that should be collected.

Vital Signs: We note that the OT-0401 protocol directed assessment of vital signs at baseline and then
two hours after each dose: in the TAHRS study, vital signs were obtained once each day. and the time of
assessment relative to administration of study drug was not recorded. Given the brief half-life of
terlipressin, it appears that there was no assessment of vitals signs during the peak drug effect. In future
trial(s), we suggest you obtain vital sign data at peak drug effect, to better characterize the
pharmacodynamic effects of terlipressin.

Laboratory Data: We note that the OT-0401 protocol did not include collection of complete blood counts
in the monitoring scheme: TAHRS required a complete blood count at baseline, Day 7 and Day 15. For
completeness, we suggest you obtain complete blood counts with leukocyte differential counts and
platelet counts should you decide to undertake an additional trial.

Attention: | Adam Harris, MM, RAC
Director, Regulatory Affairs

Dear Mr. Harris:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received December 31,
2018, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Naloxone HCI Injection, 5 mg/0.5 mL.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated May 15, 2020, which constituted a
complete response to our November 22, 2019, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

CLINICAL

1. You have not provided adequate data to support the safe use of the proposed
product ZIMHI (Naloxone HCI Injection, 5 mg/0.5 mL) pre-filled syringe for the
emergency treatment of opioid overdose in community settings. The product as
currently designed raises safety concerns for intended users. Specifically, you
haven't provided data to demonstrate that intended users are able to deploy needle
safety guard without difficulties with the current user interface in the intended use
environments. Failure to deploy the needle safety guard will result in risk of
needlestick injury after the injection. Additionally, patients who will be prescribed
may have familiarity with your product. However, the intended users could include
laypersons, who may administer this to patients. Your product, if approved, is
anticipated to be widely used in community settings by laypersons who are not
familiar with the use of the product at all. There is possibility that your product will be
used on patients with an increased rate of bloodborne pathogens disease than the
general public’. Potential risks of transmission of bloodborne pathogens from opioid-

Page 2

overdose patients to the intended users are high for your product. Your current user
interface is not adequate to mitigate potential risks of needlestick injury and prevent
risks of transmission of bloodborne pathogens from opioid-overdose patients to the
intended users.

To address this deficiency

Modify your device to include an automatically deploying needle safety element to
decrease the risk of needlestick injury (to avoid transmission of bloodborne
pathogens).

Submit your updated comprehensive use-related risk analysis (URRA) taking into
consideration the changes to the user interface. The comprehensive use-related risk
analysis should include a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of all the steps
involved in using your product (e.g., based on a task analysis) the errors that users
might commit or the tasks they might fail to perform and the potential negative
clinical consequences of use errors and task failures.

Your risk analysis should also discuss risk-mitigation strategies you employed to
reduce risks you have identified and the methods you intend to use for validating the
risk-mitigation strategies. This information is needed to ensure that all potential risks
involved in using your product have been considered and adequately mitigated and
the residual risks are acceptable.

Based on this risk analysis, you will need to submit the results of a human factors
(HF) validation study conducted under simulated use conditions with representative
users performing necessary tasks to demonstrate safe and effective use of the
product.

We recommend you submit your HF validation study protocol for feedback from the
Agency before commencing your study. Note that we will need 60 days to review
and provide comments on the HF validation study protocol. Plan your development
program timeline accordingly. Note that submission of a protocol for review is not a
requirement. If you decide not to submit a protocol, this approach carries some risk
to you because prospective Agency review is not possible, but this is a decision for
your company.

Threshold Analyses and Human Factors Submissions to Drug and Biologic
Applications? for the content of a human factors validation study protocol

logical relation (i.e., and/or) so that your device’s overall reliability calculation is
accurate and complete.

To address this deficiency:
Revise your Fault Tree Analysis to consider all the basic design and

manufacturing failure modes.

3. In your revision to Panel A from SNO053 (August 17, 2020) and Panel E from SNO055
(September 10, 2020) you make consistent logical and scientific arguments which are
unsubstantiated by your evidence or do not clearly support your claims. Without this
information, you cannot support your overall claim of successful activation/dose
delivery at 99.999% reliability and 95% confidence or 99.99% reliability and 95%
confidence. This is not intended to be an exhaustive list due to the consistent errors
identified.

To address this deficiency:

Revise your fault tree analysis and address the following:

(b) (4)
a.

ii. You provide no explanation on how you link Cpk to failure rate.

Therefore, your claimed failure rate of | is unsubstantiated by this
evidence. This is similarly noted for items in SNO055. Provide a clear
explanation linking of Cpk or other data sources (e.g., Monte Carlo
Simulations, qualifications of go-no/go gauges) to your basic failure rates
for items which you rely on statistical data.

b. In SNOO55, Table 1 of 1.11.1, for the basic failure mode “unable to actuate
due to part defects,” you point to 3.2.P.7.8.1.2.4 Tables 18 and 20-23 and
state the assessed failure rate is ©® With “Reliability analysis of
each manufactured part was found to be 99.999999%.” However:

appears to be combining data from several sources without
explaining how you relate these to your stated failure rate. Provide
an analysis that uses a single failure rate for each failure mode and
clearly link these data with logical connectors (i.e., AND, OR) to
arrive at failure rate.

. The critical dimension data in the referenced tables refers to

several Cpk values, including. You do not clearly relate these
Cpk values to your stated failure rate of © Provide the
assessment described in 2.a: a linking of Cpk(s) to a failure rate.

Under Table 23 you state, “Due to the high process capability for
the manufacture of these parts, with a Cpk of “

the critical the failure probability of this
basic failure mode was considered negligible but will be set at the

© for the purpose of the fault tree
analysis quantification.” Therefore, it is unclear why you do not use
the lowest identified Cpk in your analysis or considering all the
parts’ failure rates. Provide failure rate data for the basic events in
your analysis.

. You appear to use Cpk data in Table 18, 22, and 23 to arrive ata

failure rate. You do not provide evidence that the data is normal.
Cpk analyses are predicated on a normal data set. Provide a
normality test to demonstrate your analysis is valid.

You appear to use Cpk data in Table 20 and 21 to arrive at a failure
rate. You failed your normality test. Therefore, your Cpk analysis,
as presented, is invalid. Provide an assessment of your non-normal
data to determine why your data is non-normal and provide a
statistical analysis which is valid for your data set.

c. You provide a failure rate based on your pFMEA for several items and

justify these based on validated assembly figures and work instructions.

You do not provide process validation references demonstrating your
assembly line has been determined to be adequate. Therefore, your
determined failure rates are unsubstantiated. Provide evidence that your
assembly process and equipment are validated and can adequately
identify parts as passing or failing. Ensure the evidence clearly supports
your proposed failures rates.

In response to comment b in SNO055, you provide a statistical tolerance

analysis. However, you do not provide the source of these data, the areas

of your Fault Tree Analysis these data are supporting, or a normality
assessment of these data. We are unable to determine if your statistical

tolerance analysis is valid without knowing the source of the data, how you
collected it, how you are using it to support your claims, and that your
analysis techniques are valid. Provide a reference to the original location
of these data, explain where these data are being used in your Fault Tree
Analysis, and provide a normality test of these to determine the presented
analysis is valid.

Also consider the Complete Response Deficiency 4 regarding your needle safety
device as you revise your Fault Tree Analysis and consider that any changes to your
device design should be considered as you address this comment.

4. You provide SN0057 (October 7, 2020), in response to our September 23, 2020,
Information Request, Issue 1, which contains Table 1 and a discussion of how you
meet the recommendations in “Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Medical
Devices with Sharps Injury Prevention Features”
(https://www.fda.gov/media/71142/download) from August 2005. However, the
evidence you reference to support your claimed device malfunction mitigations in
3.2.P.2.4.4.2.4, 3.2.P.2.4.4.2.6, 3.2.P.2.4.4.2.7, 3.2.P.2.4.4.2.8 contain consistent
scientific flaws:

a. You do not detail your test methods or explain why the methods chosen
are adequate in demonstrating your requirements are verified

b. You do not state the number of samples used to verify each requirement

c. You do not justify your sample size based on the risks present in your
system

d. You do not present a complete analysis of your data: You lack both a
discussion of your approach (e.g., variable or attribute) and statistical
analysis demonstrating adequacy of the data (e.g., data normality for
variable data)

e. Your samples are not representative of your use case. For example, in
Section 3.2.P.2.4.4.2.6 you state:

i. “Units were held at 55°C for the 5.5 weeks period to simulate a 12-
month shelf and use life.” We understand your device has a shelf-
life of 18 months. Therefore, your data do not demonstrate your
device functions at expiry.

ii. “All samples subject to accelerated life testing were fabricated from
alpha build components...” However, you present no discussion
comparing the components from alpha builds to the to-be-marketed
device or state there are no functional/design changes between

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4701652

NDA 212854
Page 7

these components and your to-be-marketed device. Therefore, the
device used is not understood to be representative of your to-be-
marketed device.

f. While you state, “...after storage at 55 °C for simulated aging to 18
months, 576 devices were evaluated for needle guard function... The
result was recorded as a Pass/Fail. The acceptance criteria was:|
failures are required to demonstrate a!"" % confidence that the true
failure rate is no higher than\""% and a_""% confidence that the true
failure rate is no higher than ®%...” under Simulated Clinical Use
Testing.

i. Your referenced data in Section 3.2.P.2.4.4.2.6, which refers to
devices aged only to12 months, contradicts this statement.

ii. You provide no other data location to support this statement.

To address this deficiency:

You should demonstrate that your device functions safely at worst-case,
reasonably conceivable conditions (i.e., sterile device, at expiry, following
shipping challenge), with testing to verify your requirements are adequately met.
We recommend you review the following guidance documents as you address
this deficiency and consider the recommendations contained within:

Dear Dr. Suarez:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 27, 2018, received May 29, 2018,
and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act for Nayzilam (midazolam) nasal spray 5 mg/0.5 mL.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

QUALITY SYSTEM

We refer to our November 13, 2018, letter which identified Quality System deficiencies and
requested additional information. The deficiencies, identified in our November 13, 2018, letter,
assumed that Proximagen was the applicant for NDA 211321, and that © was the
contract manufacturer. As such, the Quality System deficiencies were limited to these firms.

Based on your, March 8, 2019, Response to the March 5, 2019, FDA-483 that FDA issued to
you, it appears that UCBBioPharma SPRL (UCB) has purchased this NDA and is integrally
involved in several aspects of the Quality System at your firm. You will need to update your
responses to FDA’s November 8, 2019, Quality System deficiencies to additionally identify how
the manufacturer UCB integrates into the Quality System established at your firm.

1. You have not adequately addressed the requirements for 21 CFR 820.20, Management
Responsibility. Please describe the specific management control responsibilities at each
facility associated with the medical device constituent of this combination product. To date,
we are aware that the only facilities with potential management control responsibilities are
Proximagen, ae and UCB. Please provide a summary of how your firm’s
management has established responsibility to assure that the combination product is
manufactured in compliance with all applicable CGMP requirements (see 21 CFR Part 4).
Also, provide a description of the functions and responsibility of each facility involved in the
manufacturing of the combination product.

IntelGenx Corp.

Attention: Ross C. D’Emanuele
50 South Sixth Street, Suite 1500
Minneapolis, MN 55402-1498

Dear Dr. D’Emanuele:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated March 26, 2013, received March
27, 2013, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for RizaFilm (rizatriptan) oral film 10 mg.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated September 26, 2019, which
constituted a complete response to our March 28, 2019, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

PRODUCT QUALITY

1) With respect to the manufacturing process:

Reference ID: 4580538

NDA 205394
Page 2

2) With respect to drug product stability:

We acknowledge the out of specification (OOS) investigations submitted in response
to the September 26, 2019, action letter. However, due to the manufacturing
process deficiencies described in Item 1 above, we have determined that stability
data obtained from testing of the existing exhibit batches cannot be used as primary
data for establishment of product shelf life. Therefore, we recommend the following:
a) Submit 12 months of long-term stability data for exhibit batches manufactured as
recommended in Comment 1. Stability testing should be performed using fully
validated methods and the suitability of analytical equipment should be verified
prior to use. The product shelf life assigned will be based on review of this
stability data.
b) If you intend to use the 2017 or 2018 batch stability results as supportive data,
provide the raw HPLC data for all corrected analytical results. Additionally,
regarding INV-2019-017, in order to support disqualification of the OOS stability
results obtained using © for analysis of this
product, further investigation is needed to identify the root cause.

FACILITY INSPECTIONS

3) During a recent inspection of the a
drug substance manufacturing facility for this NDA, our field investigator observed
objectionable conditions at the facility and conveyed that information to the
representative of the facility at the close of the inspection. Satisfactory resolution of
the observations is required before this NDA may be approved. Please list
communications submitted to, or held with, the Agency to facilitate resolution of the
observed objectionable conditions, or deficiencies, noted at the facility.

4) During the recent inspections of IntelGenx Corp. (FEI 3005721224) for oral film
products, our field investigator observed objectionable conditions at the drug product
manufacturing facility. In addition, during the review of the submission dated
09/26/2019, we are recommending manufacture of new exhibit batches tested in
accordance with cGMPs. Please note that that this information will be reviewed by
the Agency during the review of the application and a follow up Pre approval
inspection may be needed to verify that the facility has taken necessary corrective
actions to ensure oral film product quality.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information

updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(I)(1)(i)] in structured product labeling (SPL)
‘ormat as described at FDA.gov.?

CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

If you resubmit this application, include draft carton and container labeling revised as
ollows:

General Comments (Container labels and Carton Labeling)

e The usual dose statement can be improved to ensure consistency with the
Physician Labeling Rule (PLR) formatted prescribing information labeling. We
recommend you revise the usual dose statement:

to read “Recommended Dosage: See prescribing

(4)

information.”

e The current temperature statements do not contain the temperature scale
designation (i.e., “°C” or “°F”) after each numerical value. We are concerned that
this information could be misinterpreted and may pose a risk of drug degradation.
Ensure that the degree symbol and temperature scale follow each numeric value
denoting temperature ranges to increase clarity. For example, revise “59° - 77°F
(15° - 25°C)” to read “59°F to 77°F (15°C to 25°C)”.

Container Labels

e As currently presented, the format for the expiration date is “YYYY MM.”
However, it is unclear whether the month (that is, MM) will be displayed using
numerical (for example, 06) or alphabetical (for example, JU) characters.
Therefore, we were not able to assess the appropriateness of the proposed
expiration date format from a medication safety perspective. Please clarify
whether you propose to use only numerical characters for the expiration date, or
whether you propose to use alphabetical characters for the month. Additionally,
to minimize confusion and reduce the risk for deteriorated drug medication
errors, FDA recommends that the human-readable expiration date on the drug
package label include a year, month, and non-zero day, if space permits. FDA
recommends that the expiration date appear in YYYY-MM-DD format if only

numerical characters are used or in YYYY-MMNM-DD if alphabetical characters
are used to represent the month.

Carton Labeling

e It is unclear what information will be contained within the “Serialization Area.”
Therefore, we are unable to assess the acceptability of the information. Please
clarify the specific information you intend to display in the “Serialization Area.”

e As currently presented, there is no product identifier on the carton labeling. In
September 2018, FDA released draft guidance on product identifiers required
under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. The Act requires manufacturers and
repackagers, respectively, to affix or imprint a product identifier to each package
and homogenous case of a product intended to be introduced in a transaction
in(to) commerce beginning November 27, 2017, and November 27, 2018,
respectively. The draft guidance is available from:
https:/Awww.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-public/@fdagov-drugs-
gen/documents/document/ucm621044 pdf

e We recommend that you review the draft guidance to determine if the product
identifier requirements apply to your product’s labeling.

e We did not identify a placeholder (“LOT” or “EXP”) for the lot number and
expiration date on the carton labeling. The lot number and expiration date are
required per 21 CFR 201.10(i)(1) and 21 CFR 211.137, respectively. Ensure that
the lot number and expiration date are present on the carton labeling in
accordance with 21 CFR 10(i)(1) and 21 CFR 211.137.

which could lead to confusion.
Consider relocating this statement to the back panel, deleting the statement
altogether, or address this concern by other means.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:
Microbiology

1. The plunger movement study described in section 3.2.P.2.5 was not conducted
with syringes with the largest air bubble allowed by the process controls;
therefore, the study was not performed under worst-case conditions for plunger
movement during  {} transport. The amendment received June 11, 2024, noted
that a new plunger movement study will be conducted using 15 filled syringes
with plunger stopper positions manipulated manually to create a |{jmm air bubble.
Provide results from the repeated plunger movement study conducted with
syringes with the largest air bubble allowed in the syringe to ensure that sterility
of the drug product will be maintained during routine | {) transport under worst-
case conditions.

Product Quality

3. We acknowledge that you provided product quality data from relevant studies to
support risk assessment of the commercial drug product shipping; however, you
did not provide real-time/real-condition drug product shipping validation data in

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993

the BLA submission. In the information request response dated June 3, 2024,
you agreed to commit to perform a real-time/real-condition shipping validation
study and to submit the data in a future annual report. Submitting the shipping
validation data without an approved shipping validation protocol for prospective
validation of the actual commercial drug product shipping to a future annual
report is inappropriate because product quality cannot be ensured during the
actual commercial drug product shipment. Therefore, in your resubmission, we
recommend you provide drug product real-time/real-condition shipping validation
data.

Device

4. In the information request dated January 29, 2024, the FDA requested device
performance testing (either real-time or accelerated aged testing) on a total of 3
batches of the subject prefilled syringe (PFS) with needle safety device (NSD) to
include dose accuracy, peak force, injection force, and NSD activation force to
demonstrate that the device will perform as intended to the end of its proposed
shelf life of 36 months. The FDA also requested testing for a total of 3 batches of
the subject autoinjector (Al) to include dose accuracy, injection time, activation
force, extended needle length, and lockout force to demonstrate that the device
will perform as intended to the end of its proposed shelf-life of 36 months. In the
response dated February 5, 2024, we note that two additional drug product
batches of CSL312 PFS assembled with NSD and CSL312 PFS assembled with
Al will be placed on stability, and this data will be provided in an annual report. In
your resubmission, provide the results of the additional stability data rather than
in an annual report.

OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other
actions available under 21 CFR 601.3(b)). If you do not take one of these actions, we
may consider your lack of response a request to withdraw the application under

21 CFR 601.3(c). You may also request an extension of time in which to resubmit the
application.

A resubmission must fully address all the deficiencies listed in this letter and should be
clearly marked with ""RESUBMISSION' in large font, bolded type at the beginning of the
cover letter of the submission. The cover letter should clearly state that you consider
this resubmission a complete response to the deficiencies outlined in this letter. A partial
response to this letter will not be processed as a resubmission and will not start a new

Tanvex BioPharma USA, Inc.

Attention: Bonnie J. Mills, PhD

Vice-President, Clinical Development & Regulatory Affairs
2030 Main Street

Suite 600

Irvine, CA 92614

Dear Dr. Mills:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated September 28, 2018,
received September 28, 2018, and your amendments, submitted under section 351 (k)
of the Public Health Service Act for TX01.

We acknowledge receipt of an amendment dated April 29, 2019 (Document Number
25), which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of
the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited
in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

FACILITY INSPECTIONS

1. During a recent inspection of Tanvex, Inc. manufacturing facility (FEI: 3013021112)
for this BLA, our field investigators conveyed deficiencies to the representatives of
the facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this
application may be approved.

PRODUCT QUALITY
Comparative Analytical Assessment

2. During the April 23-May 2, 2019 inspection of the non-GMP laboratory at Tanvex,
Inc. (FEI: 3013021112) that conducted most of the comparative analytical studies,
several issues were raised regarding data analysis and management, and the
suitability of the comparative analytical assays. These issues may negatively impact
the reliability of the data provided to demonstrate that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-
licensed Neupogen. For example:

Reference ID: 4496557

BLA 761126
Page 2

a. some of the assays used in the 2016 study were not qualified, and formal
system suitability criteria were not in place at the time of use;

b. considerable issues were raised regarding documentation of data and
omission of data from analysis for the competitive ELISA binding assay;

c. multiple changes were made to RP-HPLC data without documented
justification, including deletion of an injection containing raw data as
documented in the audit trail;

d. lack of documentation of the method procedures followed for determining the
protein concentration of U.S-licensed Neupogen in the 2016 similarity study;

e. missing notebook record for analysis of TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen by
RP-HPLC during the 2016 similarity study; and

f. lack of written retesting procedures to manage “exceptional conditions”.

Overall, these issues raise concerns regarding the quality of the comparative analytical

data submitted in your 351(k) BLA. Therefore, at this time, there is insufficient
information to make a determination that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed
Neupogen notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components.

For the Agency to make an assessment of the application, it is critical that the data

provided in your 351(k) BLA are reliable and complete. To address this deficiency, you
will need to perform an appropriate retrospective review of all the comparative analytical
data to ensure its reliability and completeness. The retrospective review is necessary to
support a determination that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed Neupogen. This
retrospective review may rely on your own internal audit or you may need to identify an
appropriately qualified, external third party to perform an independent and thorough
audit of all the comparative analytical sources and data used to support your 351(k)
BLA for reliability and completeness. The Agency recommends that prior to initiating the
internal or external third-party audit, the scope of the audit should be clearly pre-defined
to address the items below. Although the Agency does not approve audit protocols, you
may request the Agency to review your audit protocol design and content for comments
prior to conducting the audit.

a.
b.

c.

Purpose and scope of the audit,

A description of the qualifications and experience of the audit team members with
regard to the intended purpose and scope of the audit,

Roles and responsibilities of the external third party and Tanvex, if applicable,

A description of how the external third party and Tanvex would address any
disagreements or differences in opinion that may arise during the audit process,
if applicable, and

A description of the nature and extent of information that will be included in the

final audit report.

Depending on the final audit results, as appropriate, additional studies may be needed
to generate new information and data to support the comparative analytical data in your

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

351(k) BLA resubmission. The Agency will not be able to perform a review of your
351(k) BLA until the final audit report provides assurance that all the comparative
analytical information provided in the 351(k) BLA application is accurate, reliable, and
complete.

3. Address the following regarding assessment of primary structure of TX01 and U.S.-
licensed Neupogen using Glu-C Peptide Mapping with RP-HPLC-MS/MS:

a. The peptide map data provided show differences in relative abundance of some
peptide peaks between TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen lots analyzed in the
2016 and 2018 comparative analytical studies. You attributed these differences
to variability in experimental conditions between the 2016 and 2018 studies.
However, differences are also observed in the peptide maps for TX01 and U.S.-
licensed Neupogen lots analyzed within the same study in 2016 or in 2018. You
did not address the differences observed in the TX01 and U.S.-licensed
Neupogen data collected within the same study, such as the ratio of the G1:G1-
dimer peaks. Explain the differences in peak intensity between TX01 and U.S.-
licensed Neupogen lots analyzed within the same study, including whether
sample preparation procedures may contribute to these differences. Provide data
to support that the differences do not preclude a demonstration that TX01 and
U.S.-licensed Neupogen have the same primary sequence.

b. Table 4 of Section 3.2.R.3.2 shows the sequences of the minor peaks found in
TX01 DP lot 17023. It is not clear whether the same minor peaks are found in
U.S.-licensed Neupogen. Address whether the minor peaks reported in Table 4
are also found in U.S.-licensed Neupogen in similar levels and provide
comparative data showing the abundance of these peaks in TX01 and U.S.-
licensed Neupogen. If there are differences in the identity or level of these peaks
between TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen, justify why the differences do not
preclude a demonstration that TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen have the same
primary sequence.

4. We note that the same Ellman’s assay was used to assess free thiol content for the
2016 and 2018 studies oa

Address how you determined that the assay used in the 2016 comparative
analytical assessment was fit for intended use. This information is needed to support
that the free thiol content results in TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen are reliable
and to support a demonstration that TX01 is highly similar to U.S.-licensed
Neupogen.

5. Two comparative analytical studies were conducted, one in 2016 and a second
study in 2018. During the inspection of the Tanvex Inc. facility (FEI: 3013021112)

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4496557

BLA 761126
Page 4

where most of these studies were performed, you provided a summary of the history
of changes to the analytical methods used in the two comparative analytical studies.
The summary indicated that several of the methods used in the 2016 study were not
qualified, and/or formal system suitability criteria were not established. Provide
evidence that the non-qualified methods and those run without system suitability
criteria as indicated in the inspection document “Summary of the History of Changes
to the Methods and Reference Standards used for Analytical Similarity Assessment”
were suitable for their intended use during the 2016 comparative analytical study.

6. You indicated that the CEX-HPLC method used for comparative analytical
assessment is the same validated method used in the QC lab. Additional information
is needed to assess whether the method was fit for its intended use in the
comparative analytical studies. Specifically, the method was used to compare main
peak, acidic species and basic species in TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen.
However, based on the information in reports# TR-2015-010-00 and SAN-VAL-0098
provided in the 351(k) BLA, the method was not validated for quantitation of basic
species. In addition, while the method was validated for quantitation of the acidic
species, in document SAN-DEV-0156 “Technical report for analytical
characterization of TX01 and Neupogen on Charge Heterogeneity by CEX-HPLC”
you mentioned that although the same assay was used for the 2016 and 2018
analyses, there were sensitivity differences in detection of low levels of acidic and
basic species that resulted in slight differences in the integrated and reported levels
of purity and impurities between the two studies. To support accuracy of the results
for acidic and basic species in TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen lots in each of the
studies, provide data to support that the CEX-HPLC method is fit for quantifying
basic species, and data and information to support consistent integration of both the
acidic and basic species using CEX-HPLC.

351(k) BLA, in addition to Tanvex (FEI # 3013021112), you propose additional drug
substance and drug product in-process, release, and stability testing sites (other
than container closure testing). Note that additional testing sites should be supported
by appropriate method transfer or method validation data.

Drug Substance Leachables

18. You conducted accelerated leachable studies for the drug substance container
closure system. However, you did not provide leachable data for the drug substance
container closure system at the end of the proposed shelf life under long-term
storage conditions. In addition, you did not provide information about the
assessment and control of potential leachables from the drug substance
manufacturing process,

© used during the TX01 drug substance manufacturing. Provide leachables
data from the TX01 drug substance container closure at the end of the shelf life. The
leachable studies should also include an assessment of the impact of these
leachables on product quality. In addition, provide a risk assessment and supporting
data to address the potential leachables derived from the drug substance
manufacturing process and their potential impact on product quality and patient
safety.

Drug Product Quality

19.We reviewed your IR responses submitted on March 28, 2019 for the studies
conducted to support compatibility of TXO1 DP with the I.V. administration materials.
The data provided are inadequate to support compatibility of TXO1 DP with the
administration materials for the reasons described below:

a. To support chemical stability of TXO1 DP used for I.V. administration, you
assessed potency and particulate matter of the diluted DP. Your studies did
not include assessment of all critical quality attributes of the product, such as
purity, including high molecular aggregates. Provide data to demonstrate
purity of the product with respect to size, charge, and hydrophobic variants.
These studies may be conducted as part of the data requested in comment
b(iv) below.

b. You assessed potency of TX01 to support compatibility of TXO1 DP v with the
|.V. infusion bags and infusion line.

Address the following:

It is unclear whether the potency assay used in the compatibility
studies was conducted within the validated parameters. Ua

Therefore, it
is unclear whether this variability is due to the performance of the
assay or due to compatibility issues. Address the fitness of the potency
assay used in the compatibility studies for intended use, including
whether HSA has an effect on the performance of the assay. Provide
information and data to support that the results reported in the
compatibility study are precise and accurate.

i. The potency acceptance criteria used to support the compatibility of

TX01 with selected I.V. bags are 0, relative potency. These
acceptance criteria appear to be based on the drug product
specifications using the previous potency assay with high method
variability. The potency assay was revalidated with improved precision
and the potency specifications were revised to 0% relative
potency to reflect the improvement in the performance of the potency
assay. We note that several potency results in this I.V. compatibility
study are between ©®o% Clarify and justify the acceptance
criteria of 0, relative potency used for the compatibility study.
Your justification should include your rationale for why OM,
potency is adequate from the safety and efficacy perspective.

Protein recovery should be assessed as part of the compatibility
assessment to ensure adequate dosing. For samples containing HSA
where HSA might interfere with the current protein concentration
assay, you may consider a chromatography method such as an RP-
HPLC assay for measuring protein recovery. To support the
conclusions reached with the potency assay, provide data from the
protein recovery studies. Alternatively, provide justification as to why
the potency assay provides adequate assessment of recovery.

Your data, show that the potency of TX01 at &megimL concentration is
about 0% in the LV. (polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) bag. We
also note that variable potency values including low potency values of

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993

www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4496557

BLA 761126
Page 18

0% are reported for the ®megimL concentration in the

“ |.V. bag. It is unclear whether these low recoveries as
measured by the potency assay are adequate for |.V. administration.
One possible approach to address this issue is to show that when
using the same administration materials (i.e. PVC) and polyolefin
intravenous bags, and ©® syringes), similar results are
obtained for TX01 and U.S.-licensed Neupogen. The product attributes
assessed in this study should include, purity, including aggregates,
particulate matter (visible and sub-visible particles), protein recovery,
and potency. If you pursue this approach provide these data to
address this deficiency.

20.Assessment of leachables

a. To support compatibility of TX01 with the prefilled syringe container closure
system, you provided 27 months of leachables data for the
syringe and 15 months for the ©® syringe stored at the recommended
storage condition of 2-8°C and indicated that the studies in the aa
syringe are ongoing. You also provided 32 days of leachables data for the
syringe stored at 50°C, which you stated are representative of 24
months of leachables under the recommended storage condition of 2-8°C.

(b) (4)

You stated that you considered the © syringe worst case scenario
with respect to leachables because of its higher’ ©® content. To
confirm compatibility of TX01 with the | syringe until the proposed

expiry, provide updated leachables data for the ©® syringe stored up

to the end of shelf life at the proposed long-term storage conditions.

b. You did not provide information about the assessment and control of potential
leachables from the drug product manufacturing process, oe
used during the TX01
DP manufacturing. To address this, provide a risk assessment and supporting
data to address the potential impact of process- related leachables on product
quality and patient safety.

21.To support the proposed ©® specification concentration ranges of
polysorbate 80 (PS80) in the DP formulation, you provided stability data from
formulation development studies under long term storage conditions for up to 12
months, 25° C for 6 months, and 40° C for 3 months and indicated that the
formulation studies under long term storage conditions are ongoing. The data
available under long term and accelerated storage show comparable DP stability

over the proposed PS80 concentration range of 0%. However, the data
under stressed conditions suggest that |

®® release specification concentration range are comparable, update your

application with the on-going formulation development study results under long term
storage conditions.

22. Your application contains inconsistent information regarding classification of the
following process parameters as critical (CPP), key (KPP) or non-key (NKP):

a. The number of allowed © for TXO1 drug substance is
classified as KPP in the section 3.2.P.3.3.3, and as CPP in the section
3.2.P.2.3.6.

b. You classified the ®® as NKP in section 3.2.P.3.5.3,

and as KPP in section 3.2.P.3.3.4.

c. The ®® is classified as KPP in section 3.2.P.3.3 and as CPP in
section 3.2.P.3.5.

Clarify, with justification and data, the correct classifications for these parameters and
update all sections of your application with the correct information.

23. The DP specification for volume of injection is “NLT mL” for the 300 mcg PFS

25.Based on the information provided in your 351(k) BLA, it appears that shipping
validation for both bulk TX01 DP PFS and finished TX01 DP were performed using
simulated shipping studies. If both validation studies are only based on simulated
transport studies:

a. Clarify whether the shipping containers and packaging configurations used in
the simulated studies are representative of those you intend to use for
commercial shipping.

b. Because simulated shipping qualification studies may not adequately reflect
commercial conditions, you should perform real time transport qualification
studies for the finished drug product using commercial drug product and the
mode(s) of transport, shipping containers and temperatures intended for
commercial use. Provide real time transport qualification studies data for DP.
Alternatively, you may provide a validation protocol for concurrent real time
transport qualification of drug product.

Minerva Neurosciences, Inc

Attention: Ramana Kuchibhatla, PhD

Senior Vice President and Head of Research & Development
1500 District Avenue

Burlington, MA 01803

Dear Dr. Kuchibhatla:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) oe

(b) (4)

for (roluperidone) extended-release tablets.

We also refer to your amendments dated oe

Furthermore, we refer to your Ch)

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated oe

, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable
sections of these amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the
deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

CLINICAL

We have concluded that your application does not provide sufficient data for the
Division to approve your application for the proposed indication of treatment of negative
symptoms of schizophrenia because of the following deficiencies briefly outlined below:

(1) You have not established substantial evidence of effectiveness (SEE) for the effects
of roluperidone on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Study MINI-101C03
(Study C03) demonstrated statistical significance on the primary efficacy endpoint.
However, this study is insufficient on its own to establish SEE. The phase 3 study
MIN-101C07 (Study C07) was a negative study using the pre-specified statistical
analyses, regardless of exclusion of the study site with data irregularities (Study Site

Reference ID: 5335697

NDA 217002
Page 2

om ). The Division considered your proposal that, although negative on

the prespecified primary endpoint, Study C07 may contribute to SEE based on “the
appropriateness of the multiplicity correction used, the consistency of results across
most secondary endpoints reflecting improvement in daily function, the findings of
the exposure-response modeling, the treatment effect seen beginning at Week 4,
and the consistency of results between Studies C03 and C07.” However, following
substantive review of Study C07, the Division concluded that the results from the
posthoc analysis using a multiple testing procedure that was not prespecified and
from other exploratory analyses that you proposed were not sufficiently robust to
overcome the lack of a positive result on the prespecified primary analysis, the
mixed results on the secondary and exploratory endpoints, and uncertainties
regarding the clinical meaningfulness of the result and fitness-for-purpose of the
primary endpoint.

(2) The NDA submission lacks data on concomitant antipsychotic administration. The
Division considered your position that the proposed use of roluperidone is as
monotherapy for individuals who have stable positive symptoms and do not require
continuous treatment with antipsychotics and, therefore, that “the information
necessary to prescribers to decide how roluperidone should be used and how to
manage potential risks is a topic for review and consideration of the labeling,
potentially including a limitation of use, contraindications, and/or warnings.”
However, the Division concluded that data regarding the impact on the safety and
efficacy of roluperidone when administered with an antipsychotic would be needed
to determine whether the potential benefits of roluperidone could outweigh the risks.
Current standard of care treatment for schizophrenia includes ongoing treatment
with antipsychotic medications. There are substantial risks associated with untreated
positive symptoms, and co-administration with an antipsychotic would be expected if
patients experience worsening of positive symptoms. Importantly, because
antipsychotics may lead to secondary negative symptoms or improve underlying
causes of secondary negative symptoms (e.g., paranoia, depression),
coadministration of roluperidone with antipsychotics could result in
pharmacodynamic interactions that impact safety and efficacy. It is important to
understand if roluperidone provides clinically meaningful treatment of negative
symptoms in the context of concomitant antipsychotic treatment

(3) The NDA submission lacks data needed to establish that the change in negative
symptoms of schizophrenia with roluperidone treatment was clinically meaningful.
The evaluation of the anchor-based analyses of the effect of roluperidone on
negative symptoms—as assessed by the change from Baseline to Week 12 in the
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Marder’s Negative Symptoms Factor Score
(NSFS) and the Personal and Social Performance scale (PSP)—found that the
observed change in negative symptoms was not representative of clinically
meaningful within-patient improvement in either Study C03 or C07.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 5335697

NDA 217002
Page 3

(4) Schizophrenia is chronic condition for which you have proposed chronic
administration of roluperidone. The submitted safety database included an
inadequate number of subjects exposed to roluperidone at the proposed dose (64
mg) for at least 12 months. The safety database should be consistent with the ICH
E1 Guideline for the safety evaluation of drugs intended for the long-term treatment
of non-life-threatening diseases.

To address these deficiencies, you must submit at least one additional positive,
adequate, and well-controlled study to support the safety and effectiveness of
roluperidone for the treatment of negative symptoms. You must provide additional data
to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of roluperidone coadministered with
antipsychotic medications, to support that observed effect on negative symptoms with
roluperidone treatment corresponds to a clinically meaningful change, and to
demonstrate the long-term safety of the proposed dose. The Division expects that data
from U.S. subjects will contribute to these additional efficacy and safety data. We
recommend that you discuss the design of any additional planned study or studies with
the Agency prior to study initiation.

CLINICAL/CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Roluperidone and BFB-520 are associated with concentration-dependent QTc
prolongation. You have not developed a strategy sufficient to reliably identify patients in
the intended population who would be at greatest risk of QT interval prolongation with
roluperidone. The proposed method for identifying patients by CYP2D6 genotype and
phenotype is not appropriate given that the CYP2D6 phenotype assignments used in
the development program are not consistent with current phenotyping and testing
standards.

To mitigate the risk of QTc prolongation, you have proposed that roluperidone should
only be administered after CYP2D6 genotyping results are available and only to patients
who have at least one CYP2D6 normal function allele (e.g., *1, *2, *35). You propose a
contraindication in patients who lack at least one CYP2D6 normal function allele which
you define as CYP2D6 intermediate and poor metabolizers (hereafter abbreviated IMs
and PMs, respectively).

However, your definition of CYP2D6 IMs and PMs (patients who lack at least one
CYP2D6 normal function allele) is not consistent with standard phenotype definitions,
which use activity scores. In our analyses of reclassified CYP2D6 phenotype using
standard phenotype definitions, CYP2D6 IMs were enrolled in Studies C03 and C07
(~33-37% of study populations) and almost all CYP2D6 IMs have an activity score equal
to 1. Based on the available data, there are potential safety risks in CYP2D6 IMs across
the entire range of activity scores. If the product were to be approved in the future,
based on the available data, we would recommend labeling the product only in patients
who are CYP2D6 normal or ultrarapid metabolizers (hereafter abbreviated NMs and

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 5335697

NDA 217002
Page 4

UMs, respectively) with contraindications in CYP2D6 IMs and PMs per standard
phenotype definitions which use activity scores. If an indication in CYP2D6 IMs is
pursued, additional pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety characterization would be needed
given the narrow CYP2D6 IM population (only patients with activity score equal to 1)
and sparse PK sampling in your phase 2b and phase 3 studies. In addition, due to the
potential for reduced efficacy and, therefore, altered benefit-to-risk profile, we
recommend analyses of safety and efficacy in CYP2D6 UMs compared to NMs.

Given that CYP2D6 genotyping is considered essential for safe and effective use of the
drug, development and contemporaneous authorization of an in vitro companion
diagnostic device would likely be required to ensure robust pharmacogenomic test allele
coverage and test accuracy to identify patients for treatment. The proposed
administration based on CYP2D6 genotype (patients must have at least one CYP2D6
normal function allele, including CYP2D6*1) is not appropriate given that CYP2D6""1 is
the default when tested alleles are not present (i.e., test-dependent) and there is nota
proposed in vitro companion diagnostic device to ensure test rigor and accuracy.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

(1) Roluperidone is extensively metabolized via multiple pathways (i.e., CYP as well
non-CYP based mechanisms). The PK is also impacted significantly in the presence
of CYP2D6 inhibitors. The impairment of hepatic function is anticipated to increase
systemic exposures of roluperidone and its major metabolite, BFB-520, and may
pose safety risks to patients on therapy. A dedicated safety and PK study in patients
with impaired hepatic function will ultimately be warranted to adequately inform
product labeling. You may consider a reduced design hepatic impairment study in
patients with moderate hepatic impairment.

(2) The radiolabeled mass balance study suggests that approximately 1% of
administered oral dose of roluperidone is excreted unchanged in urine. This
suggests that roluperidone undergoes substantial disposition through non-renal

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 5335697

NDA 217002
Page 9

mediated pathways. Given that uremic toxins could impact the non-renal mediated
disposition, a dedicated safety and PK study in patients with impaired renal function
will ultimately be warranted to adequately inform product labeling. We recommend
that you evaluate the safety and PK of roluperidone in a reduced design renal
impairment study in patients with severe renal impairment.

(3) Based on our analysis, roluperidone and BFB-520 are associated with
concentration-dependent QTc prolongation, which is consistent with the available
nonclinical data. In any future submission, we therefore recommend that you revise
your proposed label to describe the increase in QTc following the recommendations
in the draft guidance for industry titled “QTc Information in Human Prescription Drug
and Biological Product Labeling” (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-
fda-guidance-documents/qtc-information-human-prescription-drug-and-biological-
product-labeling). The description of the QTc increase in section 12.2 should be
based on study MIN-101C08 and analyzed using exposure-response following the
recommendations described in “Scientific white paper on concentration-QTc
modeling” (Garnett, C. et al., J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn 2017; doi
10.1007/s10928-017-9558-5) and “Correction to: Scientific white paper on
concentration-QTc modeling” (Garnett, C. et al., J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn
2018; doi 10.1007/s10928-017-9565-6).

(4) The submitted population PK model underpredicts Cmax of roluperidone. In your
resubmission, you should refine the population PK model to improve the prediction
of roluperidone Cmax.

CLINICAL

(1) We acknowledge receipt of your oe submissions
providing information about data for the ongoing Study MIN-101C18, “A Phase 1b,
Inpatient Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacodynamics, and
Pharmacokinetics of the Coadministration of Roluperidone and Olanzapine in Adult
Subjects with Moderate to Severe Negative Symptoms of Schizophrenia.” These
submissions will not be reviewed in the current cycle because of the limited time
remaining before the PDUFA date and the inability of these submissions to impact
the overall regulatory decision-making related to this application.

However, we note that Study MIN-101C18 protocol is designed to evaluate the
concomitant administration of roluperidone and olanzapine. As communicated in our
Advice Letter sent to) on oe , although the protocol would
provide short-term PK information regarding the coadministration of olanzapine and
roluperidone, it does not appear to fully address the Divison’s concerns about the
lack of data regarding the coadminstration of antipyschotics and roluperidone
because the duration of treatment is too short, the sample size is too small, and
because the clinical population intended to use this drug is likely to be prescribed a

medications and other psychotropic medications that may be prohibited per your
protocol may introduce confounding effects on the proposed safety and exploratory
efficacy outcomes in addition to placing subjects at risk for decompensation.

CLINICAL OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS

(1) We would expect additional validity evidence in order to conclude that the NSFS and
the PSP measures are fit-for-purpose in this context of use. Specifically:

Qualitative evidence from patients and caregivers, demonstrating that the items
contained in the NSFS and the PSP score are important, comprehensive, and
relevant to patients who experience predominant negative symptoms of
schizophrenia. We note that the documentation provided regarding clinician
endorsement is considered to be complete.

Development of a conceptual framework for each measure, mapping the key
concepts to each clinical outcome assessment (COA) item.

Clinically meaningful change analyses utilizing anchors that measure severity
and/or change in overall negative symptoms of schizophrenia and overall
personal and social functioning, versus severity in overall symptoms of
schizophrenia.

Additional psychometric analyses or evidence from the literature demonstrating
that key measurement properties are adequate in the NSFS score and the PSP

3M Health Care (Infection Prevention Division)
Attention: Dianne Gibbs

Regulatory Affairs Director, IPD Division
3M Center
Building 275-5W-06
St. Paul, MN 55144-1000

Dear Ms. Gibbs:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated and received July 6, 2015, and your
amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act for SoluPrep™ Film-Forming Sterile Surgical Solution (2% chlorhexidine gluconate and
70% isopropyl alcohol).

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 21, 25, and 29, 2016, which were
not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by
specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL

1. You have failed to demonstrate replicative efficacy in two pivotal clinical simulation studies,
based on the previously agreed upon primary endpoints and statistical analyses. Study EM-
05-012760 passed on all primary efficacy analyses; however, Study EM-05-013260 did not
pass the > 70% responder rate primary endpoint for the inguinal site. Thus, replicative
efficacy was demonstrated for the abdominal site, but replicative efficacy was not
demonstrated for the inguinal site. We have previously communicated to you (IND 076549,
Advice/Information Request, April 17, 2015) that your proposed alternative primary efficacy
analyses to be conducted in the event that the positive control fails to meet the 70% threshold
are not acceptable.

Conduct a repeat study of the inguinal region with adequate controls that meets the pre-
specified primary endpoint.

2. The financial disclosure information provided in the NDA is not sufficient. Eleven of 20
subinvestigators listed on the revised 1572 for pivotal study EM-05-012760 are missing
disclosure information. Also, one of the five subinvestigators is missing financial disclosure

Reference ID: 3927975

NDA 208288
Page 2

information for study EM-05-013260. The guidance for industry (E6) Good Clinical Practice
Guidance: Consolidated Guidance, section 8.2,

(http://www. fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/ucm073122.pdf) indicates that this
information should be documented before the trial starts formally. Financial arrangements
between investigators and the sponsor can introduce bias in trial data that may be difficult to
evaluate. In addition to the potential impact on efficacy outcome data, this is an issue of
study conduct.

Describe your efforts to obtain financial disclosure both before and after the trial. Discuss
the potential impact lack of financial disclosure may have on data integrity, especially
efficacy data in the pivotal trials. Provide specific information regarding the role of each
subinvestigator in the trials and whether that role had any involvement in determination or
documentation of outcome data. In order to evaluate the possible impact on efficacy
outcomes, identify how many subjects each subinvestigator had a role with during the trial.
To the extent feasible for a single center trial, submit analyses dropping the subjects of all
subinvestigators without financial disclosure per pivotal trial. Provide datasets for each
pivotal trial that allow independent verification of the sensitivity analyses, (i.e. the
subinvestigator is named for each subject by “usubjid” in efficacy datasets for each study).
As a subinvestigator may have participated in more than one trial, for each trial in the NDA
indicate whether there is missing subinvestigator information, list the missing
subinvestigator(s), and provide a listing of all subinvestigators in the respective trial. For any
additional clinical trials you conduct for this NDA, ensure that you collect financial
disclosure information prior to start of the trial. You may also provide additional strategies
you believe may evaluate this issue.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

You proposed to rely on literature to support the pharmacokinetics and absorption profile of your
chlorhexidine/isopropyl alcohol product in humans. However, you provided inadequate literature
references of human pharmacokinetic data evaluating isopropyl alcohol as a preoperative skin
preparation and for the combination chlorhexidine/isopropy! alcohol.

You may rely on adequate literature for IPA and CHG/IPA to demonstrate absorption after use
as a surgical skin preparation with a similar level of skin coverage to that proposed for the largest
size product (26 mL), rely upon FDA’s findings of safety for a listed drug(s), or conduct a
maximal use pharmacokinetic study with the final, to-be-marketed formulation of your product.

NONCLINICAL
You failed to provide qualification data for two impurities, 1 which
exceed the allowed impurity threshold per ICH Q3B (R2) guidance (1.¢., <1%) . We refer you to

the meeting minutes from the teleconference held on January 12, 2016 between representatives
of your company and the FDA.

These degradants continue to rise and accumulate in the drug product throughout the shelf-life.
Even though you have proposed interim specifications for an interim shelf-life of months,
impurity © still exceeds the ICH limit of <1.0%. Therefore, at this time, no expiration
date can be granted for this drug product.

To justify your proposed expiry dating, conduct qualification studies for Ge

MICROBIOLOGY

1. The container closure integrity test (CCIT) validation data provided in the submission
dated March 10, 2016 demonstrates that the proposed headspace oxygen analysis method
has a detection rate of approximately 33% or less for defects that are 50 ym or larger in
10.5 mL drug product (DP) filled ampules. Moreover, you did not detect defects of any
size in the 26 ml DP filled ampules. Further, the information presented indicates that
your selected test method is only capable of detecting holes of 50 um or greater, which,
per the USP 1207.1 you previously provided, corresponds to an air leak rate of > 0.360
standard cc per second (sccs). Kirsch, et. al. (also referenced in the Parenteral Drug
Association’s Technical Report 27) demonstrated that a leakage rate that correlates with
microbial ingress is approximately 10° sccs, which is considerably lower than what your
results demonstrate. With the low detection rate demonstrated by positive controls, and
without further information to correlate your proposed method with the potential for
microbial ingress, the method that you propose is not acceptable as a CCIT method.

Provide CCIT results from a validated testing method capable of detecting microbial
ingress in order to demonstrate the integrity of the proposed container closure system
(glass ampules) for the DP.

2. Provide CCIT results for the! pouch used to package the DP applicator. Provide a
description of methods (and applicable validation information), a description of controls,

Note that a backup method for sterility testing cannot be utilized for
DP release in instances where the primary sterility testing method fails or in
instances where an in-process control fails. This represents a testing-into-
compliance process, and increases the chances of acceptance of false negative
results. Clearly state the sterility testing method for the DP release, noting that
inclusion of a backup testing method is not acceptable.

9. Your proposal to utilize CCIT in lieu of sterility testing for filled ampoules in the stability
program is acceptable. Provide a stability specification which includes a validated CCIT
method.

Dear Dr. McNamara:

Please refer to your Biologics License Application (BLA) dated May 30, 2017, received
May 30, 2017, and your amendments, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health
Service Act for CT-P6.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

FACILITY INSPECTIONS

1. During a recent inspection of the Celltrion, Inc. (FEI 3005241015) manufacturing
facility, the field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the facility.
Satisfactory resolution of the deficiencies is required before this BLA may be approved.

PRODUCT QUALITY

2. Per the “Guidance for Industry: Allowable Excess Volume and Labeled Vial Fill Size in
Injectable Drug and Biological Products” (https://www.fda.gov/ucm/groups/fdagov-

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

1. You have submitted 6-month storage stability data for CT-P6 and US-licensed Herceptin
in human serum (Project RFHD2). The 6-month storage stability data does not support
the sample analysis using ELISA method (ICD546) for Study CT-P6 1.5, which was
around 18-months in duration. Submit to the BLA additional long term storage stability
data for the duration of the study covering from the date of sample collection to the last
sample analysis date.

PRODUCT QUALITY

2. Based on the October 16, 2017, and January 29, 2018, responses to our Information
Requests regarding the acceptable ranges for numerous process parameters that have the
potential to impact product quality, the limited process characterization and process
validation data may not fully justify the criticality ranking of these parameters. The
acceptability of these rankings will be a review issue once the entire control strategy is
updated and available for review.

3. We acknowledge receipt of your process characterization studies performed in order to
establish acceptable ranges for lyophilization process parameters on February 28, 2018.
The acceptability of your updated control strategy (process parameters and associated
acceptable ranges) for lyophilization will be a review issue that will be addressed in the
next review cycle upon receipt of your resubmission.

4. We recommend that you develop a two-tiered reference material system to support the
product lifecycle. An appropriately characterized primary reference material that is
representative of clinical materials can be used to calibrate or qualify a working reference
material and contributes to mitigating the risk of drift in quality attributes over time. Use
of a working or secondary reference material calibrated against a single primary reference
material for routine release and stability testing of commercial lots provides additional
assurance that commercially manufactured product is representative of the clinical trial
material.

Attention: Ronald Dundore, Ph.D.
Vice President, US Regulatory Affairs

Dear Dr. Dundore:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 17, 2012, received May 18, 2012,
submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for
Bronchitol (mannitol) Inhalation Powder.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated, May 31, June 6, 15, 22, and 29, July 13,
August 2, 17, and 24, September 6, 19, and 27, October 12, November 14, 27, and 29, and
December 19, 2012, and February 8, 2013.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL

The submitted data do not provide a favorable benefit-risk balance to support the use of inhaled
mannitol in patients with cystic fibrosis 6 years of age and older. The determination of efficacy
based on the two submitted trials are not adequate because of the treatment-related frequent early
dropouts in trial 301 for which the primary statistical analyses did not account and the lack of
statistical significance in trial 302 for the primary endpoint. Sensitivity analyses conducted on
data from study 301 either fail to confirm a treatment effect on the primary efficacy or are
problematic in that they attribute a good outcome to some patients who discontinue treatment or
they impute a single score without accounting properly for variability. In addition, there was lack
of support for efficacy from secondary endpoints in both the studies. Assessment of safety
findings show that, compared to control, subjects treated with mannitol 400 mg had a high
occurrence of hemoptysis, particularly in pediatric patients, which is concerning and does not
balance favorably with the submitted efficacy data, especially in the pediatric population.

To support approval of inhaled mannitol for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, conduct a clinical

program including at least one adequate clinical trial to show substantial evidence of efficacy in
patients with cystic fibrosis and balancing safety findings. In order to better balance benefit to

tisk, consider:1) changing the threshold for passing for the mannitol tolerance test to make it
more conservative, 2) including a lower dose of mannitol in addition to the dose that was studied,
and 3) testing efficacy and safety initially in adults and later in children informed by data from
adults. In the clinical trial include specified criteria that address the specific safety concern of
hemoptysis.

Dear Dr. Gilvary:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated September 30, 1999, submitted under
section 505(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Gepirone hydrochloride
Extended-Release 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg Tablets.

We acknowledge receipt of your submissions dated December 23, 2003, February 9, February
27, March 19, April 5, and May 19, 2004.

The December 23, 2003 submission constituted a complete response to our March 15, 2002
action letter.

We have completed our review and find the information presented is inadequate. Therefore, the
application is not approvable under section 505(d) of the Act and 21 CFR 314.125(b). The
deficiencies are summarized as follows:

Nonapproval Deficiencies

You have still not, in our view, provided substantial evidence of the effectiveness of gepirone ER
in the short-term or longer-term treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). We
acknowledge our earlier discussion with you on July 3, 2002, at which time we agreed that you
had produced evidence of short-term efficacy for gepirone ER in study 134001 and for gepirone
IR in study 03A7A-003. At that meeting, you indicated that the results from another short-term
ER study (134004) would soon be available, as well as results from a longer-term randomized
withdrawal study (28709). We indicated that, if study 134004 were robustly positive, you would
have sufficient efficacy data for filing the application. We subsequently learned, however, in an
April 17, 2003 package outlining your proposed response to our March 15, 2002 nonapprovable
letter, that study 134004 failed to distinguish gepirone from placebo. Although at first glance,
the failure of fluoxetine to show superiority to placebo suggests that study 134004 lacked assay
sensitivity, fluoxetine was in fact nearly significantly superior to gepirone, a very unusual
outcome in comparisons of two active antidepressants and a more troubling result. You
indicated, however, that your randomized withdrawal study (28709) was positive, and argued


NDA 21-164
Page 2

that this combination of two positive short-term studies, one for each of the two formulations,
together with one positive gepirone ER long-term study, should be sufficient to file the
application. In a July 14, 2003 teleconference, we agreed only that we would probably be
willing to file such an application, without reaching any agreement that this combination of
studies would represent sufficient support of the effectiveness of gepirone. We noted that part of
the difficulty was a preponderance of negative studies for gepirone in the application, making the
overall program very weak indeed.

Now that we have had an opportunity to review the data for study 28709, we do not agree that it
is a positive study. It was a fairly typical randomized withdrawal study in adult depression
(MDD), with an 8-12 week open label phase, followed by a double-blind phase in which patients
responding to open treatment with gepirone (HAMD-17 total score < 8, at week 8 or week 12)
were randomized to either continuation of gepirone (at the same dose that was associated with a
“response”) or to placebo, with a 40-44 week period of observation for relapse (defined as a
HAMD-17 > 16, or discontinuation due to lack of efficacy as determined by the investigator).
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had relapsed at the end of the
observation period, and the primary analysis was the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test (CMH), with
adjustment for centers. Time to relapse was a secondary endpoint. Survival curves were
estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology and the log-rank test was used to compare survival
distributions. Both analyses were based on a modified intent-to-treat sample, i.e., all patients
randomized who received at least 1 dose of assigned treatment and who had at least 1 post
baseline efficacy evaluation.

According to your analysis, the results on the primary endpoint, rate of relapse at study end,
favored gepirone:

Gepirone: 29/126 (23%)
Placebo: 43/124 (35%) p=0.024

However, there were two important problems with your analysis:
1. 5 patients on gepirone appeared to have had relapses, but were not included in your analysis:

Prior to unblinding the data, you identified 5 gepirone patients who appeared to have met
relapse criteria, since they were discontinued due to worsening of depression, but had not
been so designated on the CRF (as noted, discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was one of
two criteria for relapse). In fact, you have produced an internal memo, prepared prior to
unblinding, indicating that these patients would be redefined as having relapsed, and they
were so redefined. Subsequent to unblinding and analysis, you discovered that these
patients’ scores had not met the > 16 criterion, but it was too late to query investigators, since
they had also been unblinded. Nevertheless, you then decided to exclude the patients as
relapsers, on the grounds that the redefinition had not been done by formal amendment and it
had not been possible to query investigators. As it turns out, this redefinition is critical to the
outcome, since, if these 5 patients are included as relapsers, the results are as follows:


NDA 21-164
Page 3

Gepirone: 34/126 (27%)
Placebo: 43/124 (35%) p=0.101

We consider it inappropriate, after looking at the results of the analysis, to decide not to
include these patients as relapsers, when they had already been quite reasonably reclassified
as relapsers by you prior to unblinding the data. It seems obvious, on face, that these 5
patients who were discontinued for worsening depression should be counted as relapsers,
given that their discontinuations were for “worsening of depression,” whether or not there
was an opportunity to query the investigators to try to verify this result. Thus, we believe the
appropriate analysis is the one that includes these 5 patients as having relapsed.

2. Failure to include all ITT patients in the analysis

We also note that you excluded 32 patients from the analysis (CMH) because they came from
centers that had patients in only | treatment arm, or had no relapses. A more appropriate
analysis, grouping these centers, gives a nonsignificant result: p=0.10, with grouping of small
centers; p=0.08, with grouping by country. These results are negative, even with your
exclusion of the 5 relapsed patients we feel should be included. When these 5 patients are
included in these analyses with appropriate grouping of centers, the results are far from
significant (p=0.33 and p=0.31, respectively, for groupings by small center and by country).

The results on the secondary endpoint, time to relapse, also did not favor gepirone, with a p-
value of 0.089. When the additional 5 patients are included, the p-value is 0.28. Generally for
this type of study, we consider the time to relapse analysis as the more appropriate analysis, and
the one that we always recommend. The CMH analysis of proportion relapsed does not properly
address censored patients, in that it implicitly treats them as successes.

The finding of only two positive short-term trials for gepirone, one for IR (03A7A-003) and one
for ER (134001), out of a total of 19 short-term placebo controlled trials is a significant concern.
While we have accepted your explanation for the failure of many of these trials, we noted in our
March 15, 2002 letter that 3 of the short-term ER studies appeared adequate, on face, and would
ave been expected to succeed. Thus, the finding of only one of four adequately designed short-
term ER studies having a positive outcome was not reassuring. This concern was the basis for
our indicating that an additional “robustly positive” ER study would be needed. The result of the
most recent ER study (134004) adds to our concern. Although this study is on face a failure for
oth fluoxetine and gepirone, it actually favors fluoxetine over gepirone. The results for
gepirone are actually numerically worse than placebo, while the results for fluoxetine are
numerically superior to placebo, and the p-value for the fluoxetine/gepirone contrast on the
rimary outcome (HAMD-25) is strongly trending toward statistical significance (p=0.068).
Thus, of 5 short-term seemingly well- designed ER studies, only one of the five was positive.
Given this very marginal set of results for the gepirone short-term efficacy data, a robustly
ositive result for the randomized withdrawal study became even more pressing. As noted, we
do not consider 28709 to be a positive study.

In summary, you have not provided substantial evidence that gepirone ER is effective in the
treatment of MDD. While it is true that you have provided evidence of an effect from 2 short-

NDA 21-164
Page 4

term studies, these used 2 different formulations (1 for IR and 1 for ER). We do not find these
data sufficient to support the effectiveness of gepirone ER. The negative outcome on study
28709, which used a randomized withdrawal design that regularly is successful in showing the
effectiveness of effective agents, further weakens what evidence there was to support an
antidepressant claim for gepirone ER. Furthermore, as the negative data continue to accumulate,
it becomes difficult to advise you on what further work you might do to addr such a
preponderance of negativity. At this point, we would want at least a “robustly positive” short-
term trial with gepirone ER and a positive randomized withdrawal study. The short-term trial
should look at different fixed doses of gepirone ER, and the randomized withdrawal study would
need to involve a period of “response” for a minimum of 6 months before randomization.

Additionally, we have the following comments and requests that will need to be addressed in
your resubmission.

Proposed Tradename

Our Division of Medication Errors and Technical Support (DMETS) has completed their review
of your proposed tradenames of ""Variza"" and ""Alrize"". The Variza tradename was found
unacceptable because there are existing drug names that sound like or look like Variza to a
degree that potential confusion between drug names could occur under the usual clinical practice
settings. The Alrize tradename was found unacceptable because the name is misleading.

Please submit another proposed tradename for review by the Agency.

Additionally, DMETS reviewed the labels and labeling from a safety perspective. DMETS has
identified several areas of possible improvement that might minimize potential user error.

A. Blister Label (14 Count Patient Starter Kit)
1. Please include product strength.

2. If the starter kit is available in different strengths, ensure that the strengths are
clearly differentiated by using contrasting color, boxing, or some other means.

3. Add a net quantity statement.
4. Please include the statement “Each tablet contains xx mg........etc”.
B. Container Label (Professional Sample — 7 count)

See comments A-2 and A-4.

C. Container Label (20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, and 80 mg - 30 count and 500 count)

1. Increase the prominence of the established name, relative to the dosage form.

NDA 21-164

2. Relocate the product strength so that it appears below the established name, and

The Office of Compliance has informed us that the Organon Inc. Sub Akzona Inc. (West
Orange, NJ; CFN #2211109) site will be closing in June 2004. As a result, this site will need
to be withdrawn from the NDA. Please verify that Organon N.V. (OSS, NL; CFN

Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics

Your resubmission provided studies or explanations that addressed the recommendations of the
Office of Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics in our March 15, 2002 action letter.
Although your responses were generally acceptable, there are several recently identified issues
regarding the pharmacokinetics of gepirone as well as recent changes in the drug product that
are of some concern. They are as follows:

1.

You have now changed the tablet shape with a change in commercial tooling from the original
biconvex tablet to the modified flat tablets. Dissolution has only been evaluated for the 20 mg
and 80 mg strength tablets. Therefore, the 20 and 80 mg strength tablets (with the modified
flat tablet shape) are acceptable, but the 40 and 60 mg strength tablets (with the modified flat
tablet shape) are not acceptable.

Please submit results of dissolution comparisons (of the original vs. modified shape) in
multiple media with f2 comparisons to request a biowaiver for the 40 and 60 mg strength
tablets.


NDA 21-164
Page 6

2. Your proposed dissolution specifications are acceptable on an interim basis. The dissolution
specifications are as follows:

15-25% at Lh
40-85% at 5h
65-86% at 12h
> 86% at 20h

These specifications are acceptable provided that you adhere to your stated commitment to re-
evaluate the specification at 12 hours after the manufacture of 20 batches of each strength.

3. We ask that you agree to conduct the following studies as a Phase 4 commitment:

a) Measurement of the effect of intermediate inducers such as rifabutin.

b) You previously agreed to conduct an in vivo study evaluating the effects of different meal
compositions on gepirone ER pharmacokinetics as a Phase 4 commitment, and you have
stated that the study has been initiated.

c) We note your commitment to re-evaluate the dissolution specification at 12 hours after
the manufacture of 20 batches of each strength.

Within 10 days after the date of this letter, you are required to amend the application, notify us of
your intent to file an amendment, or follow one of your other options under 21 CFR 314.120. If
you do not follow one of these options, we will consider your lack of response a request to
withdraw the application under 21 CFR 314.65. Any amendment should respond to all the
deficiencies listed. We will not process a partial reply as a major amendment nor will the review
clock be reactivated until all deficiencies have been addressed.

The drug product may not be legally marketed until you have been notified in writing that this
application is approved.

If you have any questions, call Paul David, R.Ph., Senior Regulatory Project Manager, at (301)

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:
CLINICAL

As we notified you previously, this application is subject to requirements of the Pediatric
Research Equity Act (PREA) to include a pediatric assessment for all indications it
seeks in adults. Your application did not provide sufficient evidence to support the
safety and efficacy of the ezetimibe component of your product Roszet in pediatric
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), ages {to 17 years of age. As part
of your PREA requirement, you would be responsible for addressing this evidence gap
in FDA’s previous findings of pediatric safety and efficacy for ezetimibe with either
evidence from published literature or from a completed trial in pediatric patients in the
resubmission. For published literature, although data from randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) is preferable, note that evidence from observational or uncontrolled studies may
also be submitted. Published RCTs do not need to be limited to trials with treatment
arms comparing ezetimibe monotherapy versus placebo. For example, you may include
trials in which ezetimibe was administered in combination with other therapies (such as
statins) and compared to active treatment arms. Additionally, ezetimibe need not be a
treatment arm in published RCTs; for example, trials that include pediatric HoFH
patients on background ezetimibe and that provide sub-analyses by use of baseline
ezetimibe may be sufficient.

If your resubmission contains data supporting approval in adults, but the pediatric data

remains insufficient to support approval, we would anticipate issuing postmarketing

study requirements under PREA to support the safe and effective use of both

components of Roszet (rosuvastatin and ezetimibe) for the treatment of pediatric
HoFH.

Attention: Karin A. Kook, PhD
Managing Director

Dear Dr. Kook:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated May 24, 2012, received May 29, 2012,
submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for
Levetiracetam Extended-release Tablets, 1000mg and 1500mg.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated September 7, 2012, September 27, 2012,
October 11, 2012, October 25, 2012, November 29, 2012, December 17, 2012, December 28,
2012, January 17, 2013, February 25, 2013, March 4, 2013 and March 8, 2013 (2).

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated March 19, 2013, which was not
reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendment by specific
reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

We acknowledge that the data from your bioequivalence (BE) studies establish that your product
is bioequivalent to Keppra XR in the fasted state. However, examination of the data from your
two BE studies in the fed state (Studies 131 and 272) reveals that a substantial percent of patients
have plasma concentration-time curves that differ significantly between your product and Keppra
XR, despite the observation that in Study 272, your product meets bioequivalence criteria for
Cmax and AUC. As you know, the Division considers similarity of the overall shapes of these
curves to be an important factor in deciding that two products will have similar safety and
effectiveness.

Although you provided simulations suggesting that the two products are likely to be
bioequivalent at steady state (based on AUC and Cmax), the simulations provided did not

Reference ID: 3284892

NDA 204417
Page 2

demonstrate that the individual plasma concentration-time profiles after administration of your
drug at steady state would be similar in shape to that of Keppra XR.

Although you claim that, based on the Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics Review for
Keppra XR® (levetiracetam), “the range of trough concentrations resulting in subjects with
prolonged pattern of release fall within the range of observed trough concentrations of 4.6-21

mg/mL in responders at 12-hour with Keppra,” oa)

(4)

© ""Tn addition, under
Section 505(b)(2) of the FD&C Act, a sponsor may not reference the information contained in an
FDA review of the Reference Listed Drug (RLD); the Agency can only rely on the specific
information contained in the label of the RLD.

(b) (4)

®® ‘In conclusion, you have not provided
evidence that the observed differences in the shape of the plasma concentration-time profiles in a
substantial percent of patients after administration of your product with food will not affect the
efficacy or safety of your product.

In addition, because we have found that the 1500 mg tablet does not perform similarly to Keppra
XR, we cannot approve your 1000 mg tablet based on a waiver of the bioequivalence
requirement for that strength.

In addition, the 1500 mg tablet showed dose dumping potential at the highest alcohol
concentration’ in the in vitro studies. The labeling of the RLD does not have a statement
limiting alcohol use. The Division is concerned that adding an alcohol use limitation to the label
for your proposed ER formulation could lead to clinical consequences similar to those described
above regarding fed/fasting administration. This issue, however, may potentially be resolved if

you conduct an in vivo study to evaluate the impact of the observed effect in vitro.
LABELING

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling and container labels until the application is
otherwise adequate. If you revise labeling, your response must include updated content of
labeling [21 CFR 314.50(1)(1)(a)] in structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at

rate of, © We recommend providing data on the cartridges (randomly selected from at least
three different batches) using the conversion of 800 ppm nitrogen dioxide tested at the flow rates of

output levels.
Present these data in the application and use it to propose a specification for release and stability
determination for cartridges. We recommend demonstrating that the specification limits be correlated
to performance that ensures that the cartridges meeting release and stability specifications when used
under conditions representing projected use at minimum convert the contents of one cylinder of 800
ppm nitrogen dioxide © to acceptable levels of output for nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide.

3. Provide data from stability studies at long term and accelerated storage conditions to support the
proposed cartridge expiration dating period. These data should be from at least three representative
commercial scale batches and the cartridges are to be selected randomly. The stability data are to be
based on the stability indicating criteria described above. Provide a proposed post approval
commitment to a stability protocol to continue to monitor stability of new batches of cartridges on at
least one new batch on an annual basis.

communicated to the holder of DMF#. These deficiencies impact the approvability of this
application and must be corrected by the DMF holder in the form of an amendment to the DMF.

In addition to the data requested in items 1 and 2 above, the following ar are required. The release
specification for the ® cartridge is not adequate. The ® nitrogen dioxide conversion
used as the standard method with bridging studies oo
method is not acceptable. Release testing should provide a means for assuring the following quality
parameters with adequate representative data:

In addition to the data requested in item 3 above, the following are required. Provide a stability
protocol and criteria for registration stability of the cartridges and postapproval stability
commitments. Provide specifications that use the same method of functional effectiveness of the
cartridge in converting 800 ppm nitrogen dioxide ©® to nitric oxide. Cartridges should be
tested at long term storage and accelerated conditions using storage in commercial packaging. Data
from at least three commercial scale batches should be provided to ustily: the proposed expiration
period for the cartridges. Specifications should also include how sealing is evaluated at

Dear Mr. Pakulski:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated July 8, 2017, received
July 10, 2017, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for
Theragrastim.'

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated June 24, 2020, which constituted a
complete response to our June 11, 2019, action letter.

We have completed our review of this application, and have determined that we cannot
approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

FACILITY INSPECTIONS

1. An inspection of the Kashiv Biosciences LLC DS manufacture facility (FEI
3011289655), Chicago, Illinois, is required before this application can be approved
as the FDA must assess the ability of that facility to conduct the listed manufacturing
operations in compliance with CGMP. Due to restrictions on travel, we were unable
to conduct an inspection during the current review cycle for your application. While
you may respond to deficiencies in this Complete Response Letter while the travel
restrictions remain in effect, please note that the application cannot be approved
until the required FDA inspection is conducted and any findings are assessed with
regard to your application.

For more information, please see the FDA guidances related to the Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) public health emergency.”

! Your proposed proprietary name, Releuko, and proposed proper name, filgrastim-ayow, are conditionally accepted
until such time that the application is approved. In this document, we refer to your proposed biosimilar product by
using the descriptor Theragrastim, a developmental code name.

Audit Completeness and Data Traceability
2. We understand that you identified © as the third-party to audit your
quality data and systems to support BLA 761082. However, it is unclear whether the
™® audit reviewed all the quality data submitted in the BLA because the! audit
covered data mainly generated during the years 2015-2017 and the clinical DP lots
40-13013 and 45-14042 were manufactured on November 9, 2013 and July 19,
2014, respectively. Also, it is not clear whether there are source data traceability
issues in the comparative analytical assessment including lots used in clinical
studies submitted in the BLA. The audit team reported (see pages 596-7 of
“Response to Retrospective Review of the GMP Systems and Product Quality Data
of Theragrastim by! Oa».

a. some HPLC raw data and UV data were not traceable to the source, and

b. SDS-PAGE data for the clinical lot 45-14042 manufactured on July 19, 2014
were not available for review during the audit.

The Theragrastim lots for which source data are not traceable should not be included in
the comparative analytical assessment. To address this deficiency:

a. Provide a table listing all lots, tests performed with those lots, and the dates of
testing that were retrospectively reviewed during the | audit.

b. Identify results that were included in the comparative analytical assessment
but cannot be traced back to the source.

c. Remove untraceable data from the comparative analytical assessment. If the
source of the data is known but the source is unavailable for FDA inspection,
then the data are considered untraceable.

Depending on the impact of removing untraceable data from the comparative analytical
assessment you may need to conduct additional comparative analytical studies, repeat
clinical studies, or both.

reported the detection of two sequence variants, S77-R77 and G101-R101 from a
peak (CEX-P6) separated using the CEX-HPLC method. However, you did not
provide an explanation for the etiology of the sequence variants or whether the
sequence variants impact the conclusions reached in your comparative analytical
assessment. To address this deficiency, provide an explanation for the sequence

variants, and whether the variants impact a determination that Theragrastim is highly
similar to US-licensed Neupogen. Depending on the etiology of the sequence
variants and their impact on a determination that Theragrastim is highly similar to
US-licensed Neupogen, you may need to develop a strategy to control or remove
these sequence variants in Theragrastim.

In-House Reference Standards

4. The stability protocols PTL-1981 “Stability Protocol for Theragrastim Primary
Reference Standard ™® «Stability Protocol for
Theragrastim Working Reference Standard” are deficient because there are no
acceptance criteria established to control for EC50 values. To address this
deficiency, update the stability protocols for in-house primary and working reference
standards to include adequate control over EC50. Because you have not established
a working reference standard (WRS) and you have been using the primary reference
standard (PRS) in QC testing, you should perform a trending analysis of the EC50
values obtained during routine release and stability testing to establish a stability
acceptance criterion for the PRS. After a WRS has been established and used in QC
testing, you may use a similar strategy to establish a stability acceptance criterion for
the WRS. Provide a detailed description of how you propose to perform this trend
analysis and how the acceptance criterion is going to be defined.

Post-Approval Stability Protocol

5. We noted deficiencies in your stability specifications and stability protocols for
Theragrastim DP. The DP stability protocols listed in section 3.2.P.8.2. indicate to
test for syringe break loose and glide force determination and follow specifications
per SPC-0031 “Theragrastim Drug Product (DP) Specification”. However, we noted
that SPC-0031 does not list stability specifications for this quality attribute. Also, we
noted you schedule to test container closure integrity (CCI) only at the 12-month
time-point but not at the 24-month time-point. To address these deficiencies:

a. update the DP stability specifications to assess for syringe break loose and
glide force, and

b. modify the DP post-approval stability protocols to include CCI testing at the
24-month time-point.

Shipping Validation Protocol

6. We noted the following deficiencies in the shipping performance qualification
protocols PTL 2079 and PTL-2080 for the DP in vials and pre-filled syringes:

a. You proposed to use the lower filling volumes in the shipping validation
studies without providing adequate justification that the lower filling volumes

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4721287

BLA 761082
Page 5

represent worst-case scenarios, and it is inconsistent with your response to
June 11, 2019, CR item # 25, that the higher filling volumes will be used in the
shipping validation studies.

b. There is no test to examine the primary and secondary packaging systems to
ensure that there is no physical damage to the packaging systems after
shipment.

To address the above deficiencies, revise the DP shipping validation protocols to:

a. provide adequate justification that the lower filling volumes represent worst-
case scenarios,

b. update the protocols to include examination of the primary and secondary
packaging systems for physical damage.

PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise
adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR
Requirements for Prescribing Information? and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final
Rule? websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and the Selected
Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) - a checklist of important format items
from labeling regulations and guidances. In addition, we encourage you to review the
FDA guidance for industry Labeling for Biosimilar Products.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing Information
conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your response must include
updated content of labeling [21 CFR 601.14(b)] in structured product labeling (SPL)
format as described at FDA.gov.®

proposed proprietary name, Releuko. This name was found acceptable pending
approval of the application in the current review cycle. Please resubmit the proposed
proprietary name when you respond to the application deficiencies.

SAFETY UPDATE

When you respond to the above deficiencies, include a safety update. The safety
update should include data from all nonclinical and clinical studies of the product under
consideration regardless of indication, dosage form, or dose level.

1.

Describe in detail any significant changes or findings in the safety profile and
their relevance, if any, to whether there may be clinically meaningful differences
between the proposed biosimilar product and the U.S.-licensed reference
product.

. When assembling the sections describing discontinuations due to adverse

events, serious adverse events, and common adverse events, incorporate new
safety data as follows:

e Present new safety data from the clinical studies for the proposed indication
using the same format as the original BLA submission.

e Present tabulations of the new safety data combined with the original BLA
data.

e Include tables that compare frequencies of adverse events in the original BLA
with the retabulated frequencies described in the bullet above.

incorporating the drop-outs from the newly completed studies. Describe any new
trends or patterns identified.

Provide case report forms and narrative summaries for each patient who died
during a clinical study or who did not complete a study because of an adverse
event. In addition, provide narrative summaries for serious adverse events.

Describe any information that suggests a substantial change in the incidence of
common, but less serious, adverse events between the new data and the original
BLA data.

Provide updated exposure information for the clinical studies (e.g., number of
subjects, person time).

7. Provide a summary of worldwide experience on the safety of this product,
including adverse events known to be associated with the use of the product and
immunogenicity. Include an updated estimate of use for this product marketed in

other countries.

8. Provide English translations of current approved foreign labeling not previously

submitted.

Additional Comments

In addition, there are several comments that are not approvability issues, but need to be

addressed.

1. You did not provide appropriate information to support that there is no impact on
the RP-HPLC (STM-0076) and CEX-HPLC (STM-0042) method validation after
replacing the United States Pharmacopeia reference standard (USP RS),
FOL526, with in-house © as a reference standard for the
methods. Specifically,

a.

Figure 6.6b in PTL-1193-R indicates that USP RS FOL526 and in-
house © showed differences in RP-HPLC
chromatographic patterns, specifically, the reduced peaks did not align.

We cannot locate data showing that CEX-HPLC chromatogram profiles
for USP RS FOL526 and in-house © are comparable.

To address this concern, provide appropriate information supporting the suitable
performance of in-house © in these methods.

2. We noted deficiencies in the stability protocols for the in-house reference

standards:

a.

PTL-1981 “Stability Protocol for Theragrastim Primary Reference
Standard ™» does not include adequate replicate runs
to robustly test potency. For the primary reference standard, a
sufficient number of tests should be performed at the time of stability
testing to achieve a statistically significant mean EC50 value. To
address this deficiency, update the stability protocol to include
sufficient replicates for potency testing.

In PTL-2305 “Stability Protocol for Theragrastim Working Reference
Standard”, your Table 11.1a is entitled “Theragrastim in-house Primary
Reference Standard ° Stability Specifications’. It is our

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993

www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4721287

BLA 761082
Page 8

understanding that Table 11.1a refers to WRS rather than PRS.
Provide the correct reference standard for that table.

3. We noted deficiencies in the protocols for qualification of new cell banks.

a. We noted the following deficiencies in protocol PTL-2168 “Protocol for
generation and characterization of new Theragrastim master cell bank
and working cell bank”:

i. The protocol does not include alert limits, action limits, or criteria for
trend analysis of quantitative in-process and release data from the
Theragrastim DS lots produced using the new working cell banks
(WCB) against historical DS lots manufactured using previous WCBs.

ii. |The protocol does not include acceptance criteria for cell growth
kinetics from fermentation process, including doubling time, growth
rate, age at harvest, and percent cell viability and viable cell
concentration; and productivity, such as titer.

To address these deficiencies, update the protocol to include adequate acceptance
criteria to ensure that new WCB perform comparably to previous WCBs.

4. In your response to June 11, 2019, CR item #24c, you concluded that methods
STM-0078 (UV) and STM-0076 (RP-HPLC) produce comparable results for
protein concentration by showing a difference of less than in protein
concentration values measured by these two methods in the real-time stability
studies. However, your justification is not adequate because the stability data in
report file PTL-1088-R for the previous in-house indicate that
protein concentration values measured by these two methods showed up om
difference: using STM-0076 (RP-HPLC) at the 26-month time-poin
vs. using STM-0078 (UV) at the 49-month time-point. To address

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4721287

BLA 761082
Page 9

this deficiency, provide an appropriate justification to demonstrate that the two
methods STM-0078 (UV) and STM-0076 (RP-HPLC) will produce comparable
results for protein concentration.

We acknowledge that you provided data to support that the removal of
kanamycin in tel nae fermentation processes does not have an
impact on manufacturing process and product quality. However, the final

conclusion will be made after the review of the final report that you committed to
submit.

OTHER

Within one year after the date of this letter, you are required to resubmit or take other
actions available under 21 CFR 601.3(b). If you do not take one of these actions, we

COMPLETE RESPONSE

Delcath Systems, Incorporated

Attention: John Purpura

Executive Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance
810 Seventh Avenue, Suite 3500

New York, NY 10019

Dear Mr. Purpura:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated December 21, 2010, received
December 22, 2010, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act for Melblez Kit, [melphalan for injection, 50 mg per vial, and Delcath hepatic
delivery system].

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated August 15, 2012, August 31, 2012,
September 11, 2012 (2), October 1, 2012, October 16, 2012, October 19, 2012, October 23,
2012, November 2, 2012, November 16, 2012, December 3, 2012, December 4, 2012 (2),
December 26, 2012, December 31, 2012, January 11, 2013, January 18, 2013, February 6, 2013,
February 8, 2013, February 11, 2013, February 15, 2013, March 6, 2013, March 19, 2013, and
March 26, 2013.

Your August 15, 2012, submission constituted your response to our February 18, 2011,
Refusal-To-File letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

Clinical

1. The NDA does not contain data demonstrating substantial evidence of effectiveness for
the claimed indications for the clinical trial configuration of the Melblez Kit.
Demonstration of substantial evidence of effectiveness requires a conclusion that the
benefits of a product outweigh its risks. The Melblez Kit cannot be approved because the
results of clinical investigations do show that the product is not safe for use under the
conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling since the ris
outweigh its benefits [21 CFR 314.125(b)(3)]. Based on the demonstration of a 5.4-
month improvement in median hepatic progression-free survival, the 3-month
improvement in median overall progression-free survival, and the trend suggesting a
detrimental effect on overall survival in Protocol DSI-MEL-2005-001 and the 7%

Reference ID: 3372401

NDA 201848
Page 2

incidence of toxic death and observed risks of serious cardiovascular, hepatic,
gastrointestinal, and bone marrow toxicities in the overall safety experience in 122
patients treated at the proposed recommended dose and route of administration, we have
concluded that these risks of Melblez Kit treatments, obtained with an earlier version of
the product which you do not intend to market, outweigh its benefits for the proposed
indication of treatment of patients with hepatic-dominant metastatic ocular melanoma.

To address this deficiency, you must conduct and provide the results of an adequate and
well-controlled clinical trial(s) which demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness
on an endpoint where the clinical benefits of Melblez Kit outweigh its risks. Given the
serious risks of Melblez Kit treatment, we recommend that you perform an adequate and
well-controlled randomized trial(s) to establish the safety and efficacy of the Melblez Kit
using overall survival as the primary efficacy outcome measure. You should ensure that
the trial is designed to ensure applicability of the results from this(these) trial(s) to the
United States (US) population. The design, conduct, and results of this trial will
determine whether one additional trial will be sufficient to support a marketing approval.

2. The NDA lacks substantial evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled
investigations, as defined in 21 CFR 314.126, that the drug product for which you are
seeking approval (i.e., the proposed commercial product containing the “to-be-marketed”
device configuration) will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the
conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling [21
CFR 314.125(b)(5)]. We have determined that safety and efficacy data obtained with
other versions of the device cannot be extrapolated to the combination product which is
the subject of this NDA, either directly or through bridging studies. To address this
deficiency, you must provide data demonstrating substantial evidence of effectiveness in
which these benefits outweigh its risks using the combination product that you intend to
market.

Clinical Pharmacology

3. The NDA does not contain sufficient information to characterize the pharmacokinetic
profile of melphalan when administered by the dose and route of administration proposed
for the Melblez Kit, as required under 21 CFR 314.50 (d)(3) and the investigations
required under section 505(b) of the act do not include adequate tests by all methods
reasonably applicable to show whether or not the drug is safe for use under the conditions
prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling [21 CFR 314.125(b)(2)].
Because of the differences in the dose and route of administration for melphalan as
proposed in product labeling and as studied in clinical trials of Melblez Kit to that in the
approved labeling for melphalan, FDA cannot rely on the prior findings for Alkeran
(melphalan hydrochloride) for Injection (NDA 020207), for all aspects of the
characterization of pharmacokinetics of melphalan.

To address this deficiency, you must provide data from clinical trials using the

combination product that you intend to market. The collection of melphalan
pharmacokinetic samples should be sufficient to adequately characterize the systemic

Reference ID: 3372401

NDA 201848
Page 3

exposure to melphalan and its major metabolites and to characterize the pharmacokinetic
profile in special populations in order to meet the requirement to identify any
modifications of dose or dose interval needed for specific subgroups, as discussed in 21
CEFR 314.50(d)(v).

Product Quality (Melblez Constituent Part)

4. The NDA does not include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show
whether or not the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or
suggested in its proposed labeling, as required under 21 CFR 314.125 (b)(2), for testing
of extractables, leachables of the Delcath Hepatic Delivery System, melphalan simulated
in-use stability, and melphalan interaction (adsorption) with the Delcath Hepatic Delivery
System.

To address this deficiency, you must provide the following:

a. A complete description of the Gas Chromatography (GC) and High Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) Standard Test Methods used to analyze for
extractables of the Melblez Kit.

b. A method validation summary demonstrating that the analytical methods are
suitable for their intended use, as described in ICH Q2(R1) Validation of
Analytical procedures: Test and Methodology (Nov. 2005). Validation
summary(ies) should be submitted for the analytical procedures used in the
following studies:

. Leachables of the Delcath Hepatic Delivery System
. Melphalan simulated in-use stability in Delcath Hepatic Delivery System
. Melphalan interaction (adsorption) testing with components of the device

Product Quality (Delcath Hepatic Delivery System Constituent Part)

5. The NDA does not include adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show
whether or not the drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or
suggested in its proposed labeling, as required under 21 CFR 314.125 (b)(2)
Specifically, the NDA did not contain a comprehensive toxicological risk assessment of
all the leachables from the device components in the proposed commercial product.
Instead, the NDA contained study reports demonstrating that twenty target chemicals in a
leachable study of the device component of the to-be-marketed product were at or below
pre-specified acceptance criteria ( ™ #1717106, 1717109,
1717110). Although it was not clearly explained, it appears that the acceptance criteria
specified in the reports were developed based on the toxicological risk assessment of the
clinical trial configuration. Such an approach is not valid to evaluate the potential risks
of systemic toxicity from the device components of the commercial product because the
changes in manufacturing of the filter components (manufacturer, material source,
manufacturing method and process, etc.), which are significant. In study 1715313, new

Reference ID: 3372401

NDA 201848
Page 4

chemicals that were not previously identified in exhaustive extraction studies of clinical
trial configuration of this product were present in the extracts of the commercial
configuration. In addition, the leachable chemicals that were previously found at an
acceptable level and not included in the targeted list might present at a higher level and
be a toxicological concern. To address these deficiencies, you must provide a new

toxicological risk ass
additional information:

a.

Reference ID: 3372401

sment of the commercial configuration that includes the following

Determine the leachable profile of the device components in the proposed
commercial product in nonpolar solvents (e.g., alcoholic solution) under
simulating extraction conditions. The leachable profile in the proposed
commercial product was determined only on simulated extraction by saline or
purified water (PW). The leachable profile of the device in blood could be
significantly different from the profile of the device components in polar solutions
(e.g., Saline and PW), both qualitatively and quantitatively, since blood contains
lipids and proteins and can result in more hydrophobic chemicals leaching out of
the device than the polar solvents.

Determine and provide justification for the acceptance criteria for the leachable
study of the commercial configuration, which should be based on proper
toxicological risk assessment of the leachable and extractable profiles of the
commercial confiuguration. It is inappropriate to re-estimate the tolerable
exposure (TE) for those chemicals for which the LD50 value was used in the TE
calculation in the toxicological risk assessment of the clinical trial configuration
( © 11102053).

The TE for many chemicals in your previous toxicological risk assessment
(N102053) was derived from the LDSO value, often with a modifying factor (MF)
of 1000 being applied. The LDSO value represents a dose with a very severe
endpoint. In your re-evaluation, please follow the recommendations in the ISO
10993-17:2002 standard, e.g., if only acute lethality data are available, a MF
greater than 10,000 should be used. The study by Venman and Flaga (1985)
indicated that a no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) value could be
conservatively estimated from the LD50 using a conversion factor of 1000.
Adding the default values for uncertainty factor (UF) 1 (10) and UF 2 (10), an
overall conversion factor of 1 x 10° is reasonable when estimating a TE from the
LDSO value.

Based on the material chemical characterization study (report 1715313), it
appears that only the filter! of the Gen 2 cartridge without housing material
were tested, despite the change in filter housing material from of in
the Gen 1 cartridgeto © in the Gen 2 cartridge.

Determine the extractable profile of the housing material to complete the
toxicological risk assessment of the Gen 2 cartridge of the commercial
configuration. In addition, provide additional information regarding the filter

Page 5

©® ‘to include the total amount of each detected chemical per device and

chemical identification and quantification of all peaks detected by liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry(LC/MS). Report all the chemicals that can be
detected and identified in the leachable study and conduct a new toxicological risk
assessment of the proposed device in the commercial configuration using
principles outlined in the ISO 10993-17:2002 standard.

Provide justification for the determination of acceptable limits of certain
leachables (e.g., ©) that were beyond the
estimated TE based on findings from the simulating leachable study. The
justification should discuss the acceptability of the risk of exposure to these
leachables under for the proposed indication and intended clinical use of the
commercial product.

Unless these chemicals could not be detected in the commercial configuration,
please expand the list of target chemicals to be verified in the leachable study.
We note that certain chemicals (e.g.,

that have been identified to pose significant
concern in the toxicological risk assessment ( © 102053) are not listed as
the targeted chemicals to be verified in the leachable study.

Report the level of these chemicals in the simulating leachable study of the device
components of this combination product and provide justification of the safety of
the proposed levels based on their respective TEs.

Provide the total weight and the surface area or volume of the filter media!
per each cartridge and the weight or surface area specifications for components
that have blood contact and are the subject for toxicological risk assessment.

With regard to items 6-14, the NDA cannot be approved because there is insufficient information
about the product to determine whether it is safe for use under the conditions prescribed,
recommended, or suggested in its proposed labeling [21 CFR 314.125(b)(4)].

6. The NDA contains insufficient information on the source of raw materials for the device
components of the proposed commercial product, as described under 21 CFR
814.20(b)(4)(ii). In Section 3.2.R.4.3, only the materials of construction are listed for the
the device configuration and various device components of the proposed product.

To address this deficiency, you must include the specific formulation and model numbers
for your raw materials, as well as these materials’ suppliers.

7. The NDA does not contain information on the @ a component of the GEN2
filter cartridge. To address this deficiency, you must provide a complete description of

address this deficiency, you must describe the methodology for determining the particle
size distribution of the filter) ©, including specification of detection limits for the
method used in the evaluation and acceptance criteria for the particle size distribution.

The NDA contains incomplete information on results of bench testing of the Isofuse
Double Balloon Catheter (Section 3.2.R.4.5.2.4). We note that the NDA includes
information on some of the aspects of testing of the balloons, such as deflation time,
cyclic testing and extended time use and these tests are adequate.

To address this deficiency, you must provide catastrophic failure data for these balloons
(e.g., testing balloon burst points) to establish their failure points.

The NDA contains insufficient information to assess the potential risks of the change in

the supplier for the SF Infusion Catheter ( ©) from |
to oa

To address this deficiency, you must specify whether use of this new supplier resulted in
changes to the materials of fabrication of this component or to its manufacturing. In
addition, depending on the extent of the changes in material of fabrication or
manufacturing, you must also provide data characterizing the potential risks of this new
component under the proposed indication and intended clinical use.

The NDA contains insufficient information to determine the completeness of the risk
evaluation of the extracorporeal circuit. As described in the NDA, the Extracorporeal
Circuit - Commercial Configuration consists of filter inflow and outflow assemblies, as
well as a prime/flush line, a return line with integrated bubble trap with filter, and
pressure monitoring lines for connection of the circuit to pressure transducers.

To address this deficiency, you must confirm that the bench testing described in Table
3.2.R.4.5.2.3-2 included all these components. Please note that all components must be
verified and tested, particularly for tensile strength, functionality (e.g., connection to
pressure transducers), and pressure/leak endurance. In addition, you must specify how
many samples were tested in your Saline Spike to Saline Bag Compatibility Test (DV-
BO081R, Rev. 0), as this value was not identified in your Table 3.2.R.4.5.2.3-2, and
provide justification for the number of samples tested.

Additional information is needed to determine the adequacy of the biocompatibility
testing to support the proposed commercial product.

In order to ensure that the results of testing are valid, the following information must be
provided:

Reference ID: 3372401

NDA 201848
Page 7

a. Provide additional biocompatibility testing of the extracts of the filter media from
the commercial configuration using the proper extraction ratio and condition to
maximize the exposure to the filter media.

The filter media were not separately tested. In addition, the extracts were
prepared using the © ratio instead of the surface area/volume ratio,
which is generally preferred for testing of a device with direct contact with
circulating blood. Therefore, it is unclear whether the filter media were
adequately represented in the test article. Provide cytotoxicity, sensitization, and
hemolysis testing of the filter media alone using an extraction ratio that is
appropriately justified when it is compared with the intended clinical exposure.
Alternatively, provide adequate justification that such testing is not necessary.

b. Provide an explanation as to how the test article was divided into two test groups
in complement activation testing ( ® study 160944). If filter media
were not separately tested in this study, conduct C3-a and SC5b-9 complement
activation testing of the filter media alone.

c. Identify all the components of the commercial product that were considered part
of the circuit and included in the testing.

13. The NDA contains insufficient information on the maximum pre- and post-filter pressure
and the rationale for the acceptance criteria. Per the study protocol of studies DV-C034
and DV-C037, the acceptance criterion for in-line pressure differential across filters is
specified as “shall not exceed © at the clinical flow rate of 500

milliliter/min/filter.” Since the actual pressure difference in both the GEN1 and GEN2

filters was considerably smaller than the acceptance criterion of © the rationale
for this acceptance criterion is unclear and has not been adequately justified. In addition,

it appears that a maximally allowable pre-filter pressure has not been specified.

Since higher pressure may cause mechanical hemolysis and may be associated with
thrombosis or tubing kink, in addition to the specification on differential pressure across
the filters, the maximal pre- and post-filter pressure must be specified and the acceptance
criteria must be adequately justified.

14. The NDA does not contained detailed colorant information, such as the chemical identity,
for colorants used in the manufacture of device components which are in direct contact
with the systemic circulation. Therefore we cannot assess the risks to human subjects
from colorants in the commercial product under its intended use and proposed indication.
To address this deficiency, you must provide the following information:

a. Chemical name and the Chemical Abstract Services (CAS) number of each key
colorant in the formulation.

b. Estimated absolute amount of colorant (in weight) per device.

Reference ID: 3372401

NDA 201848

Page 8
c. Size range of colorant.
d. Purity level of colorant.
e. Release capability of colorant.

f. Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for each colorant.

g. Identification of other US marketed medical devices by device name,
manufacturer, and submission #, where the colorants have been previously used,
if known.

h. Toxicity assessment of the colorant or a rationale for why additional toxicity

testing for the device containing the colorant is unnecessary.

15. The NDA cannot be approved because the methods to be used in, and the facilities and
controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of the drug substance
or the drug product are inadequate to preserve its identity, strength, quality, purity,
stability, and bioavailability [21 CFR 314.125(b)(1)]. The shelf life validation studies
you have performed are not sufficient to support your proposed two-year expiration date.
This is because you used accelerated aging methods for your test samples, but did not
validate or correlate your accelerated aging protocols with real-time, ambient conditions
testing. To resolve this deficiency, you must change your device’s shelf life to a value
based on the real-time, ambient storage testing of your device. Alternatively, you can
provide adequate real-time aging validation data for the accelerated aging methods you
are using.

Human Factors Study:

The NDA cannot be approved because there is insufficient information about the drug to
determine whether the product is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or
suggested in its proposed labeling [21 CFR 314.125(b)(4)]. Specifically, the NDA does not
contain data from an adequate human factors study.

16. | The Human Factors engineering summary report indicated that the product design and
labeling were modified after completion of clinical studies in order to address six use-
related hazards observed. However, there were no data demonstrating that the
modifications have adequately addressed all of the hazards and that they did not
introduce any new hazards.

In addition, the use Failure Mode and Effect Analysis showed about 30 use-related
hazards, where the risk severity is estimated at a 4 and 5 on a 5-point risk scale, where
potential use errors and failures could result in serious patient harm i.e. drug-infused
blood leaks into the patient general. However, the NDA did not include data that
demonstrate that proposed mitigations have adequately minimized/reduced all of the
risks.

Reference ID: 3372401

NDA 201848

To address this deficiency, you must either provide the results of a Human Factors
validation study performed with at least 15 representative US users in each of the major
user groups or provide evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of the certification
program with representative US users prior to the initiation of additional efficacy trials
required to address items | and 2 of this letter. The purpose of a human factors validation
study is to demonstrate that the device can be used by representative users under
simulated use conditions without producing patterns of failures that could result in
negative clinical impact to patients or injury to device users. Tasks included in the study
should be those identified through completion of a risk assessment of hazards that may be
associated with use- related problems and represent greater than minimal risk to users.
The study should collect sufficient and appropriate data to facilitate identification and
understanding of the root causes of any use failures or problems that do occur. The causes
may be related to the design of the device, the device labeling (including instructions for
use), and/or the training of test participants. The test report should present a summary of
your test results, data analysis, and conclusions regarding safe and effective use and
including whether any modifications are indicated; if they are, these modifications should
be described and if significant, the modifications should also be validated.

k Evaluation and Mi

mn Strategy (REMS) Requirements
17. Section 505-1 of the FDCA authorizes FDA to require the submission of a risk evaluation

and mitigation strategy (REMS) if FDA determines that such a strategy is necessary to
ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks [section 505-1(a)].

Reference ID: 3372401

We acknowledge receipt of your proposed REMS on December 3, 2012, which contains
a © elements to assure safe use, implementation

system and a timetable for submission of assessments of the REMS.

In accordance with section 505-1 of the FDCA, we have determined that a REMS is
necessary for Melblez Kit, if it is approved for ocular melanoma metastatic to the liver, to
ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the serious risks of hepatic failure, gastric
ulceration or perforation, hemorrhage, and procedural complications.

The REMS, should it be approved, will create enforceable obligations. We will continue
discussion of your proposed REMS after your complete response to this action letter has
been submitted.

Facility inspections

18. During a recent inspection of the Queensbury, New York, manufacturing facility for this
application, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the representative of the
facility. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application
may be approved.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

Clinical Pharmacology

19. — The NDA did not contain the results for exposure-response analyses exploring the
relationships between melphalan systemic exposure and common or serious adverse
reactions using either the “clinical trial” version of investigational product or the version
of the product, Melblez Kit, for which you are seeking marketing approval in accordance
with 21 CFR 314.50 (d)(3) and as described in FDA Guidance for Industry: Exposure-
Response Relationships - Study Design, Data Analysis, and Regulatory Applications
(April 2003), found at:
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guid

ances/UCM072109.pdf.

Please identify your plan for conducting an assessment of the exposure-response
relationships between melphalan concentration and adverse drug reactions based on
complete pharmacokinetic profile obtained in clinical trials using the version of the
product you intend to market. This plan should describe the data to be used, the analysis
plan, and the timeline, including key milestones, for submission of this information.

20. Based on the observed toxicity profile obtained with the clinical trial version of the
Melblez Kit at the proposed dose of 3 mg/kg IBW, we recommend that additional clinical
trials be conducted to explore the potential efficacy of a lower dose of melphalan and of a
longer filtration time to reduce systemic exposure following completion of the melphalan

Reference ID: 3372401

NDA 201848

infusion (i.e., filtration for longer than 30 minutes following completion of the melphalan
infusion). The goal of such trials would be to investigate whether such modifications to
the proposed recommended dose would result in a favorable benefit: risk profile.

Product Quali elblez Constituent Part

21. The HPLC ® analysis data in the report 10T_32509 01 (Delacath System
Circuit) indicate that the OM was
used to generate the data whereas the description of HPLC conditions for a
indicates that the |

should be used. Please explain this discrepancy.
Product Qualit elcath Hepatic Delivery System Constituent Part

22. The NDA did not contain the results of genotoxicity testing of the Gen 2 filter and the
new extracorporeal circuit components according to ISO 10993-3:2003 nor did it contain
adequate justification that such testing is not necessary based on comparable leachable
profiles of the filter and extracorporeal circuit components of the two configurations and
negligible concerns with genotoxicity of your device based on a toxicological risk
assessment. Since the device components of the Melblez Kit are considered to be an
external communicating device with limited contact with circulating blood during each
treatment, in accordance with the FDA blue book memo G#95-1, genotoxicity testing of
your device is recommended. The genotoxicity testing of device components used in the
clinical trial version of this product is not sufficient to address this recommendation
because of the different filters used in the clinical trial version (Gen 1) and in the product
you intend to market (Gen 2). Since the Gen 1 and 2 filters are manufactured by different
manufacturers, a different manufacturing process and source of materials may lead to
different leachable profiles of your device, qualitatively and quantitatively.

23. | The NDA contains insufficient information to fully characterize the hemocompatibility of
the device components in the proposed commercial product. Clinical trial data and non-
clinical studies indicate that filtration alters cellular (e.g., hemolysis, leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia) and other components (40% decrease in amylase levels and 30%
decrease in albumin, cholesterol, and fibrinogen from prescreen through post-filtration)
of the blood and also results in hemodynamic instability. The non-clinical studies that
evaluated the hemocompatibility of the Gen 2 filter included an invalid control, i.e., the
GEN] filter, and data on all effects, especially those not resulting in specific toxic effects,
were not reported.

a. We recommend that non-clinical studies of adequate design be conducted to
evaluate the hemodynamic effects of the device components of your proposed
commercial product. In these non-clinical studies, the control should be a sham.
control, either an FDA cleared, approved predicate, or reference device, or both,
and the study should be conducted without administration of melphalan to isolate
effects attributable to the device component of the proposed commercial product.

Reference ID: 3372401

NDA 201848
Page 12

Assessments should be obtained at multiple, different time points, with a specific
plan for histopathological examination of major organs, examination of thrombus
formation, and close monitoring to characterize cardiovascular adverse event
rates.

b. In non-clinical studies, information on a standard panel of hematology and
clinical chemistry parameters were collected, however the report contains
information on, and analysis of, a subset of these parameters. Since these
parameters might characterize the adsorption selectivity of the filter component,
this information should be reported and analyzed as part of product
characterization.

24. | The NDA states that you purchased a sterile extracorporeal circuit that is manufactured,
packaged, and sterilize © However, it
is unclear whether the extracorporeal circuit components included in the proposed
commercial product, which have been modified since the completion of the major
efficacy trial, are from the same manufacturer and cleared by FDA. To allow FDA to
document the supplier of the components in your product to track future supplier change
of your device, please specify the manufacturer of the extracorporeal circuit components
included in the proposed commercial product. Please clarify whether the modified
extracorporeal circuit components have been cleared by FDA and specify the 510(k)
number of the submission. If the modified extracorporeal circuit components have not
been cleared by FDA or modified since clearance, please remove the reference to

© and specify which component is not a cleared device.

Labeling
In your resubmission, submit revised draft labeling that addresses the following comments.
General Comments:

25. The prescribing information contains trailing zeros in the following sections: Highlights
of Prescribing Information (Dosage and Administration), Full Prescribing Information
(Dosage and Administration), Overdosage, Clinical Studies and How Supplied. We
recommend deleting the use of the trailing zeros in these areas of the insert because they
can lead to ten fold dosing errors when the number is misinterpreted. For example, 3.0
mg/kg may be misinterpreted as 30 mg/kg.

Highlights of Prescribing Information:

Manhasset, New York 11030

Dear Dr. Chaly:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated October 29, 2009, received October 30, 2009,
submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Fluorodopa
F 18 Injection.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated January 26, February 5, April 14, June 16, July
28, and September 27, 2010; November 9 and December 12, 2011; January 19, February 7, March 14
and 21, April 11, 17, and 18, October 22 and 23, November 13, and December 17, 2012; January 3,
14, and 16, April 5, June 7, July 19, August 13 and 21, September 16, and October 10, 2013.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined that we
cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this
action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

CLINICAL / STATISTICAL

Your application contains no data from adequate and well controlled clinical trials. Significant
deficiencies have been identified in the referenced literature studies and in the studies you have
conducted in support of this application. The data submitted in your application are not sufficient
for evaluating the diagnostic effectiveness and usefulness of Fluorodopa F 18 PET in the proposed
patient population.

1. The following deficiencies have been identified with clinical Study #15, which was
conducted at the Feinstein Institute of Medical Research:

a. The study is a retrospective, single center study.

b. The study was not conducted according to a pre-specified protocol, and hence,
definitions of the primary efficacy endpoint and the standard of truth that would
normally be specified by a protocol, are not well-defined for the study.

Reference ID: 3394281

NDA 200655
Page 2

c. The study used each patient’s clinical diagnosis at the time of referral for a
Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan as the standard of truth for measuring the test’s
performance characteristics. We do not find such a standard to be clinically
meaningful and do not agree with the cited diagnostic performance measurements of
Fluorodopa F 18 as 100% for sensitivity and 100% for specificity.

d. Of the 185 study patients, 158 patients had a pre-imaging clinical diagnosis of
Parkinson’s disease and were responding to Parkinson’s disease medications. For
these patients a Fluorodopa F 18 PET scan provides no additional clinically useful
information. Deficiencies concerning the remaining 27 study patients are discussed
below (Study #16).

e. You have provided no documentation that Fluorodopa F 18 PET images have been
read independently by three readers blinded to clinical information. Furthermore,
inspection of the study site revealed that none of the 47 audited cases contained
documentation that each patient’s images were read by three blinded readers.

2. Study #16 is a publication with the follow-up results of 27 Fluorodopa F 18 PET negative
patients enrolled in Study #15. Study #16 has the following major deficiencies:

a. Per your amendment dated April 5, 2013, only 8 of the 27 Fluorodopa F 18 PET
negative patients from Study #15 were followed for 2 to 4 years to obtain the
patient’s final clinical diagnosis. Clinical data from such a small number of patients
do not provide a reliable assessment of the performance characteristics of Fluorodopa
F 18 PET. Furthermore, inspection of the study site revealed that none of the subject
files contained documentation (clinical follow-up confirmation) of the continued
absence of classical Parkinson’s Disease symptoms and signs.

b. The reasons for not obtaining follow up on the remaining 19 patients are not
provided.

3. Among the remaining literature publications in your application (Studies #17-23), only the
publication by Eshuis et al. (Study #21) provides clinical data for the assessment of the
efficacy of Fluorodopa F 18 as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical. However, Study #21 does
not provide substantial evidence of efficacy for the following reasons:

a. The study is a small single center study and is exploratory in design.

b. All study patients had a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease at the time of enrollment.
The study excluded patients with atypical signs and patients not responding to
Parkinson’s disease medication. Therefore, the study does not evaluate a patient
population that might benefit from a diagnostic imaging test.

c. The definition of positive scans (mean standard uptake value in patients below two

standard deviations of the mean in healthy controls) is an exploratory quantitative
measure and its threshold is arbitrarily set.

Reference ID: 3394281

NDA 200655

Page 3

d. It is unclear how specificity was calculated, as all patients included in the analysis of

the study had confirmed Parkinson’s disease.

To address these deficiencies, we recommend the following:

1.

Conduct an adequate and well-controlled clinical trial which might
evidence of effectiveness of Fluorodopa F 18 in the intended patient
encourage you to develop such a study using a pre-defined standard

rovide substantial
population. We

We reference the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) deficiencies identifi

ed during our

inspection of your clinical study site and communicated to you on March 22, 2013.
These deficiencies call into question the reliability of the clinical data in your application.
It is necessary to conduct a study in compliance with GCP standards to ensure the quality

and integrity of the data.

GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE (GCP) INSPECTION

A GCP inspection was performed at the clinical site where Studies #15 and #16 were conducted.

As noted during the inspection, a prospective study protocol and case report forms were not used and
important study records (including source records) were not available for inspectional review.
Additionally, the adequacy of clinical safety monitoring could not be determined. As a retrospective
documentation of the clinical experience at a single center, these studies do not appear to have been
performed under adequate GCP standards sufficient to support a regulatory submission.

Reference ID: 3394281

NDA 200655

Page 4

During the inspection of your clinical study site, deficiencies were conveyed to you for failure to
prepare and maintain adequate case histories and for inadequate investigational drug disposition
records with respect to dates, quantity, and use by subjects. The following is a detailed description of
these deficiencies:

1.

Referral diagnoses were not adequately documented as part of subject case records. The
subject files did not contain the physician referral letter in 15 of the 47 files audited. The
files typically lacked documentation of the presence of the cardinal features of
Parkinsonian syndrome and/or responsiveness to Parkinson’s disease drugs.

The case records for the control subjects did not include evidence of an adequate
neurological examination by a qualified neurologist.

For all the subjects audited, the case records lacked evidence of PET scan interpretation
by three separate blinded readers.

Study treatment and procedures were not adequately documented. For example, there
was no documentation of carbidopa administration prior to Fluorodopa F 18 in a total of
18 of the subject files audited and the use of concomitant medication was inconsistently
documented.

For Study #16, none of the subject files contained documentation (clinical follow-up
confirmation) of continued absence of classical Parkinson’s disease symptoms and signs.

For Study #15, the available study records indicated that the PET scan procedure was
discontinued in one subject due to an undocumented adverse event. This observation is
inconsistent with your claim of no adverse events in the study.

PRODUCT QUALITY

You have not adequately responded to our requests for information dated December 28, 2012
and May 31 and July 2, 2013. The following issues remain outstanding:

1.

Regarding specifications for the precursor of the drug substance, add a test method and
acceptance criteria to establish the chiral identity of the precursor (i.e., the L-isomer
only). Provide experimental and characterization data including optical rotation
measurements for the precursor to the drug substance adequate to justify the proposed
acceptance criteria.

Provide the revised drug product specifications, in tabular format, in the appropriate drug
product section of your NDA (Section 3.2.P.5.1 Specifications). A separate discussion of
drug substance specifications in the drug substance section of the NDA is not necessary.
Describe all analytical methods in the drug product section 3.2.P.5.2 Analytical
Procedures. Provide a revised document with tracked changes identified.

Dear Mr. Blanks:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated June 26, 2020, received June
29, 2020, and your amendments, submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act for tenapanor hydrochloride 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg tablets.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated April 28, 2021, which
extended the goal date by three months.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

CLINICAL

To support efficacy as monotherapy for reducing serum phosphorus in patients with
chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis, you submitted the results of two randomized,
multi-center trials (TEN-02-201 and TEN-02-301). You also submitted the results of a
third trial — a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (TEN-02-202), to
support use in combination with existing phosphate binder treatment. All three studies
evaluated tenapanor’s efficacy in reducing serum phosphorus levels.

In epidemiologic studies, elevated serum phosphorus levels have been associated with
an increased risk of secondary hyperparathyroidism, vascular, valvular, and other soft
tissue calcification and cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD. In patients on
dialysis, higher serum phosphorus levels have also been associated with increased
mortality. To date, however, there are no data from outcome studies demonstrating that
a treatment’s effect on serum phosphorus levels predicts its effect on clinical outcomes
such as cardiovascular events or mortality. Nevertheless, the Division of Cardiology and
Nephology, following the precedent set by the former Division of Metabolism and
Endocrinology Products, treats serum phosphorus reduction as a valid surrogate in
patients with CKD on dialysis. All currently marketed products for the control of serum

Reference ID: 4833092

NDA 213931
Page 2

phosphorus in patients with CKD on dialysis were approved based on effects on serum
phosphorus levels. In the trials conducted to support approval, these therapies lowered
serum phosphorus levels by ~1.5 — 2.2 mg/dL.

In both monotherapy trials, tenapanor’s efficacy in reducing serum phosphorus levels
was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal period. In
Study TEN-02-201, which compared different dosing strategies, an 8-week double-blind
randomized treatment period preceded the randomized withdrawal phase; in Study
TEN-02-301, which included an active comparator, a 26-week open-label, randomized
treatment period preceded this phase. In both studies, the primary efficacy analysis
during the randomized withdrawal period was to be based on the Efficacy Analysis Set,
a subset of the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which was intended to enrich for a
responder population. Specifically, the Efficacy Analysis Set limited the primary efficacy
analysis to patients who achieved a reduction of 2 1.2 mg/dL in serum phosphorus level
in the treatment period prior to randomized withdrawal.

Among the patients randomized to tenapanor in the 26-week open-label treatment
period of Study TEN-02-301, approximately 60% finished the 26-week treatment period
and were re-randomized to receive tenapanor or placebo during the 12-week
randomized withdrawal phase. Of the 219 patients who were randomized into the 8-
week treatment period of Study TEN-02-201, approximately 75% completed the 8-week
treatment period and entered the 4-week randomized withdrawal phase. Of those who
entered the randomized withdrawal period, approximately half were excluded from the
Efficacy Analysis Set used for the primary analysis in Studies TEN-02-301 and TEN-02-
201.

Among the trials, the largest treatment effect was observed in the Efficacy Analysis Set
of Study TEN-02-301. In Study TEN-02-301, the point estimate of the treatment
difference in the LS mean change in serum phosphorus from baseline to the end of the
12-week randomized withdrawal period was 1.37 mg/dL based on the Efficacy Analysis
Set. However, the clinical relevance of this estimand is unclear given that it was derived
from a subset of the trial population. Analyses based on the ITT population of the
randomized withdrawal periods in Study TEN-02-201 and Study TEN-02-301 provide
perhaps the best estimate of the average treatment effect in the subset of patients who
are likely to tolerate tenapanor and remain on therapy. The sizes of the treatment
effects in this subset were small— 0.72 mg/dL and 0.66 mg/dL, respectively.

We further note that subgroup analyses and analyses of the distribution of the
responses did not suggest a “responder” population with a substantially larger response
to treatment. In exploratory analyses of the 26-week active controlled treatment period
of Study TEN-02-301, tenapanor’s effect size appeared to be larger in patients with
more marked elevations at baseline; however, the effect size still appeared to be
smaller than that observed with the active control, and, absent a placebo control, the
results of these analyses are challenging to interpret. In Study TEN-02-202, which
evaluated tenapanor use in combination with existing phosphate binder treatment, the

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4833092

Page 3

size of the treatment effect was similar to that observed in the monotherapy trials—
0.65 mg/dL.

Although we agree that the submitted data provide substantial evidence that tenapanor
is effective in reducing serum phosphorus in CKD patients on dialysis, the magnitude of
the treatment effect is small and of unclear clinical significance. In some diseases, we
have data from interventional trials that can be used to understand the quantitative
relationship between treatment-induced changes in a surrogate and changes in Clinical
outcomes. In this disease state, we do not have such data. And, while there is well-
established precedent for accepting serum phosphorus as a surrogate endpoint and

need to conduct an additional adequate and

phosphorus or an effect on a clinical outcome thought to be caused by

hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients on dia

lysis. We note that, in principle, it may be

possible to individualize treatment based on a patient's early response to a drug that
lowers serum phosphorus levels (i.e., assess for a response at some early time point
and only continue treatment in patients who have a clinically relevant response);
however, such a strategy would need to be prospectively tested and would also likely
need to be based on multiple measurements of serum phosphorus over time to
distinguish the treatment effect from intrasubject variability.

(PF-05280014).

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated March 26, 2018, April 10, 2018, and
April 17, 2018, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable
sections of the amendments by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies
cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application and have determined that we cannot approve
this application in its present form. We have described our reasons for this action below and,
where possible, our recommendations to address these issues.

PRODUCT QUALITY

1. Reference is made to the information and data provided to the Agency concerning the
stability of the PF-05280014 Working Cell Bank (WCB) on January 22, 2018 and
February 9, 2018. Although the likely root causes for the instability have been identified and
corrective actions were implemented in late 2017, the information and data do not support
the suitability of the current WCB for commercial production.

Reference is also made to your response received on February 21, 2018 to Question | of the
Agency’s Information Request (IR) dated February 13, 2018 concerning the PF-05280014
Master Cell Bank (MCB). Because the MCB has undergone extensive transfers since its
inception, the information and data provided by the February 21, 2018 response are
insufficient to account for the potential impact on MCB stability from these transfers.

To support a well-controlled and consistent commercial production of PF-05280014, you will
need to provide adequate data and information to confirm the stability of the MCB. Once the

Reference ID: 4251743

BLA 761081
Page 2

stability of the MCB is confirmed, you should qualify a new WCB or validate use of the
MCB for commercial production.

2. References are made to your response received on September 22, 2017 to Comment | of the
Agency’s IR dated September 1, 2017, and your response received on February 16, 2018 to
Comment la of the Agency’s IR dated February 9, 2018. The Agency does not agree that the
data from the Extractable Content experiment support that the lower limit of the fill weight
range used during drug product (DP) manufacturing will result in vials filled with sufficient
DP to consistently meet the label claim of 420 mg. The recovery data in the calculations
used to support the filling range is based on the average recovery of @™%, and not the
worst-case recovery of ™ Based on the calculations, a DP vial filled
at the lower limit of the fill weight range of © recovery would be (Gy
which would not meet the label claim of 420 mg. Tighten the lower fill weight rejection
limit and provide data to support that DP vials filled at the lower fill weight limit can
consistently deliver 420 mg of PF-05280014.

3. The information and data provided to support the commercial DP shipping validation do not
provide sufficient assurance that the quality of the DP is maintained during commercial
shipping and distribution. We have the following comments:

a. The mechanical performance studies, which include an independent evaluation of
vibration and physical shock, are not sufficiently representative of potential stresses
induced during routine distribution conditions, where additional factors may
contribute stress (e.g., temperature and pressure changes) and multiple stresses could
occur concurrently. Therefore, these studies cannot on their own be used in lieu of
performing real-time DP shipping validation studies. Provide shipping validation
data for the DP from real-time shipping studies or from appropriate simulation studies
that are sufficiently representative of the commercial shipping conditions. The data
should include an assessment of product quality of pre- and post-shipping DP
samples. Include a detailed description of how the study was performed and if
performed using simulated studies, provide a justification for how the simulated
studies are sufficiently representative of the commercial shipping conditions.

b. It is not appropriate to leverage stability data to support the allowable shipping
temperature range of ™ because DP is subjected to additional stresses during
shipping, which could potentially impact product stability. To support shipment
outside of the validated 2-8°C range, real-time shipping studies or sufficiently
representative simulated studies, as described above, should be performed to support
the allowable shipping temperature range.

c. The ability of the passive pallet shipper to maintain the storage temperature of 2-8°C
in the actual shipping lanes has not been demonstrated. Provide the shipping
validation summary report of the passive pallet shipper in the actual shipping lanes
during winter and summer conditions in the BLA resubmission.

4. Implement the following specifications for the control of PF-05280114:
a. Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) is one of the potential
mechanisms of action for trastuzumab. In your response received on
February 05, 2018 to Comment 6c of the Agency’s IR dated January 17, 2018, a

Reference ID: 4251743

BLA 761081
Page 3

cell-based FcyRIIla reporter gene assay was provided as a surrogate assay to assess
ADCC activity in the reference material qualifications. Implement this test, or
another validated assay, with appropriate acceptance criterion to control for ADCC
activity for DS and DP release and stability. The acceptance criteria should be based
on product understanding, current process understanding, and clinical experience.

b. As noted in the Agency’s IR on November 7, 2017, isomerization of Asp102 (iso
Asp102) is shown to impact the potency of trastuzumab. The iso Asp102 is enriched
in the BO peak in CEX-HPLC and the BO peak of PF-05280114 increases under mild
thermal stressed conditions (Section 3.2.8.3.1); therefore, a control strategy for iso
Asp102 should be in place to ensure product safety, quality and potency. Given that
your current potency assay is not sensitive enough to detect changes in iso Asp102
and it is not appropriate to control iso Asp102 using CEX-HPLC (Refer to IR dated
January 4, 2018), an assay should be developed and implemented to control for the
level of iso Asp102 for DS and DP release and stability, with appropriate acceptance
criterion.

c. As part of the Agency’s current considerations regarding the control of effector
function, it is understood from publicly available literature that high mannose species
contribute to the total level of afucosylated variants. Given the impact of
afucosylated variants on potency, we recommend that the total level of high mannose
be included as part of the control strategy for the PF-08250114 DS. Implement an
appropriate control for high mannose into the DS release specification. The
acceptance criteria should be based on the current process understanding and clinical
experience.

d. Polysorbate 20 is a critical excipient that can impact product quality and stability.
Add testing and quantitative acceptance criteria for Polysorbate 20 to the
PF-05280014 DP release specification.

e. Add the test of “extractable content” to the DP release specification with the
acceptance criterion of “No less than 420 mg” to ensure that DP lots will meet the
label claim.

5. The justifications for specifications provided in Sections 3.2.S.4.5 and 3.2.P.5.6 are not
sufficient to support some of the release and end of shelf life acceptance criteria for the
PF-05280014 drug substance (DS) and DP. The acceptance criteria for release and end of
shelf life should be sufficiently narrow to allow for adequate control of DS and subsequent
DP and should be based on your clinical and manufacturing experience. For some product
quality attributes that change during storage, it is not appropriate to have the same acceptance
criteria for DS and DP release and end of shelf life. The specifications should be set such
that materials released at the limit of the acceptance criteria will not result in out of
specification results during storage. For some attributes, the DS release and/or end of shelf
life specifications should be tighter than those for DP release and/or end of shelf, to avoid DP
lots going out of specification. Based on these concepts, the following acceptance criteria
should be tightened:

a. Appearance (Color) for DS release and end of shelf life
b. Acidic and Basic species by CEX-HPLC for DS and DP release and end of shelf life

Reference ID: 4251743

BLA 761081

6. The additional storages for PF-05280014, as specified in the proposed label, include storage
at 30°C for a single period up to 3 months for unopened PF-05280014 or storage at 2-8°C for
up to 28 days for PF-05280014 reconstituted in BWFI, within the long-term storage of 48
months at 2-8°C. The information and data provided in the submission are insufficient to
support these additional storage conditions. For example, product quality attributes including
ADCC (or FeyRIIa binding) and the levels of iso Asp102 were not assessed to demonstrate
that there is no impact on these attributes during these storage conditions. Provide additional
information and data to support the proposed additional storage conditions.

7. Method transfer data were provided for the reduced and non-reduced CGE assays from Pfizer
St. Louis to Grange Castle; however, no information and data (e.g., from method validation
or method transfer) were provided to support that these assays are validated at the Pfizer St.
Louis site. Because Grange Castle is the only DP release testing site for these assays
(Section 3.2.P.3.1), the method validation for these assays used for commercial DP lot
release and stability testing is considered incomplete. Provide information and data to
support the method validation of these assays at Pfizer St. Louis.

8. Reference is made to your response received on January 22, 2018 to Comment Id of the
Agency’s information request dated December 26, 2017. We disagree with your assessment
that the © is a low risk operation. As
stated in the Agency’s IR, |
represents higher risk for process performance consistency and, subsequently, product
quality. Data from commercial scale manufacturing experience and/or process validation
that has undergone the © operation should be provided to support this process and
process controls. Provide information and data to support the proposed operations at

scale, or remove the description of: © operations for the © from
Section 3.2.S.2.2 of the BLA.
9. Media fill simulations used to validate 9 for PF-05280014 drug product are

not included in the BLA. Provide summary data from three media fills performed on fill line

4 in the BLA resubmission.

10. The maximum hold time of PF-05280014 drug produc © proposed in
the BLA is not supported by relevant microbiology data. Provide summary microbial data
from hold time studies conducted in the holding vessels used for PF-05280014 in the BLA
resubmission.

11. Capping process parameters for PF-05280014 drug product and BWFI diluent vials do not
specify maximum differential forces. Excessive capping differential forces may damage
vials and compromise product sterility. For each capper, specify a maximum differential
force and provide summary results which demonstrate container closure integrity after
capping at a maximum differential force in the BLA resubmission.

12. Vial washing parameters and washing validation summary data are not included in the BLA

or in DMF. Provide validation summary data and information from three runs
performed on each vial washing machine for © in the BLA

Reference ID: 4251743

BLA 761081

resubmission. Specify vial washing parameters for PF-05280014 drug product and BWFI
diluent vials.

13. Bioburden action limits for PF-05280014 drug product have not been provided for the step
© Establish bioburden action limits for this step
and provide those limits in the BLA resubmission.

14. The results of the low endotoxin recovery (LER) study performed with the gel clot method
are summarized in section 3.2.P.5.3; however, raw data were not provided. Provide the LER
study report in the BLA resubmission which describes the method performed and includes
raw data (+/- gel clot) to support the reported percent recoveries. Describe the calculations
performed to quantify endotoxin. Clarify the type of endotoxin standard used in the LER
studies (CSE or RSE) and update section 3.2.P.5.3 accordingly.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

1.

Reference ID: 4251743

The proposed acceptance criteria for the control of size variants, including HMMS by
SE-HPLC, Intact IgG by non-reducing CGE, HC+LC and fragments by reducing CGE,
for DS and DP lot release and stability are too broad and are not justified based on your
manufacturing experience. Provide additional information (e.g., clinical experience) and
data (e.g., structure function characterization results) to support the proposed acceptance
criteria, or tighten these acceptance criteria to ensure that size variants of PF-05280014
DS and DP are properly controlled.

Reference ID: 4251743

In Section 3.2.S.2.2, the proposed © rejection limit of oe

is not appropriate and does not reflect your current

experience for developmental, clinical, and commercial productions. The information
and data provided in response to the Agency’s IR (Comment 2b; dated
December 26, 2017) were based on a small-scale study

and therefore are insufficient to support the proposed rejection limit.
Tighten the rejection limit for © based on your current manufacturing
experience, or provide data generated from the commercial scale process to support the
proposed rejection limit.

(b) (4)

Insufficient information was provided to support the process parameters and acceptable
ranges for the 7 (Section 3.2.8.2.2). Provide data from
process development studies to support these ranges or tighten the operation ranges based
on current manufacturing experience and/or process validation studies.

Reference is made to your response received on February 21, 2018 to Comment 6c of the
Agency’s IR dated January 17, 2018. While the validation report (VAL100054746) for
the FcyRIIla reporter gene assay included an assessment of the majority of method
validation parameters expected for a potency assay, the stability indicating capacity of
this method was not evaluated. We are recommending that ADCC activity of
PF-05280014 be controlled for the DS and DP at release and on stability (see CR
Comment 4a above under “Product Quality”). If you choose to use your FeyRIa
reporter gene assay as the means to control for ADCC activity, the stability indicating
capability of this assay should be assessed (e.g., by using stressed/forced degraded
samples under appropriate conditions). Provide detailed information and data to
demonstrate that this method is suitable for its intended use.

Reference is made to your response on January 22, 2018 to Comment 8 of the Agency’s
IR dated December 26, 2017. The overall coverage of the host cell proteins (HCP)
recognized by the antibodies in the HCP ELISA ® is poor; therefore, the data and
information provided in the IR response is not sufficient to support the use of this assay

© Provide additional information and data to support the
coverage of HCP specific for PF-05280014 producing cell line by the anti-HCP
antibodies employed in the HCP ELISA.

Reference is made to your response on February 05, 2018 to Comment 3b of the
Agency’s IR dated January 17, 2018. You have agreed to include selectivity criteria to
the system suitability criteria for both cation exchange and size exclusion HPLC
methods. Provide the updated method description for these methods in the re-submission
(e.g., in Section 3.2.S.4.2).

Submit product-specific information related to sterilization and depyrogenation validation
of containers, closures, and equipment in section 3.2.P.3.5 of the BLA rather than in a
Drug Master File.

Dear Dr. Mu:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) submitted and received on
November 27, 2020, submitted under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act for
BAT1706.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated September 30, 2021, October 8,
2021, and October 29, 2021 which were not reviewed by all disciplines for this action.
You may incorporate applicable sections of the amendments by specific reference as
part of your response to the deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

1. Selectivity data from the experiments conducted in normal human serum during
the validation of the bioanalytical method to quantitate concentrations of
BAT1706 and EU-Avastin did not meet the acceptance criteria, which may
suggest the presence of interference that may impact the ability to accurately
measure the BAT1706 and EU-Avastin concentrations. Therefore, the PK data
from Study BAT1706-001-CR could not be used to support a demonstration of
biosimilarity or establish the PK component of the scientific bridge to support the
relevance of data generated using EU-Avastin as the comparator product in
study BAT1706-003-CR. As a result, there is insufficient PK data to conclude that
BAT1706 has no clinically meaningful differences from US-Avastin in terms of
safety, purity, and potency.

To address this deficiency, repeat experiments at the lower limit of quantitation

(LLOQ) and high quality control (HQC) to establish the selectivity of the
bioanalytical method for BAT1706 and EU-Avastin.

BAT1706, US-Avastin, and EU-Avastin from Studies BAT1706-001-CR and
BAT1706-003-CR, the bioanalytical cross-validation comparability between the
BAT1706, US-Avastin, and EU-Avastin were not considered optimal. To address
this comment, conduct precision and accuracy experiments to assess bias using
QC samples and calibration curves prepared from the three products (BAT1706,
EU-Avastin, and US-Avastin).

Attention: John Kim

Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs
180 Park Ave, Suite 101

Florham Park, NJ 07932

Dear John Kim:

Please refer to your new drug application oe

for dienogest and ethinyl estradiol tablets.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application. We have described our reasons for this action
below.

1. Review of the safety database from Study LPRI-424/303 clearly demonstrates a
markedly increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) rate. A higher VTE
rate associated with the same dienogest and ethinyl estradiol (DNG/EE)
combination as your proposed product as compared to other combination oral
contraceptives (COCs) in the European postmarketing database further
substantiates an increased risk of your proposed fixed dose combination product.
The benefit/risk profile for this COC product is unacceptable for an indication of
prevention of pregnancy.

() (4)

We are unable to recommend any further actions that would result in approval of this
application. If you choose to submit a new original NDA for a different COC product that
would have a more favorable benefit/risk profile, we would consider that product on its
own merits.

Dear Ms. McNeil:

reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address

HUMAN FACTORS

(3) Based on the evaluation of the human factors (HF) validation study results, the

user interface does not support the safe and effective use of the proposed
product. The results of the HF validation study demonstrated several use errors
and close calls with critical tasks that may result in harm to the patient.
Specifically, results from your HF validation study demonstrated that several
participants used the product inappropriately resulting in use errors (e.g., failure
to wipe nozzle tip, administration of a second pump actuation in the same nostril,
administration of a single pump actuation in both nostrils). These use errors led
to administration of higher than intended doses of drug substance.

As conveyed in he Discipline Review letter, we note that the
majority of available nasal products delivered through pump actuation have an
associated mental model of a single dose consisting of administration of drug

substance into both nostrils. Conversely, scopolamine nasal gel is intended to be
administered as a single dose consisting of one pump actuation of drug

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 5316661

NDA 214315
Page 4

substance into a single nostril.
Information needed to resolve the deficiencies:

Implement user interface revisions and design modifications to promote the safe and
effective use of the proposed product, and provide data demonstrating that, with these
mitigations, the product user interface can be used safely and effectively to deliver the
intended dose of drug substance.

As the established mental model may limit the impact of measures to mitigate the
identified medication errors (e.g., administration of a dose higher than intended), we
recommend you consider the potential for a dose of your product to be provided within
the existing mental model (i.e., for a dose of product to be delivered as 0.08 mg of
scopolamine nasal gel per a single pump actuation in each nostril, to provide a total
dose of 0.16 mg of scopolamine nasal gel over 2 actuations of the device).

Prior to conducting an assessment to evaluate the impact of any mitigation strategies
(e.g., modifications proposed during the oe teleconference including
changes to the principal display panel of the carton, modifications to the device label,
inclusion of a Quick Start guide), we recommend submitting your HF validation study
protocol, along with the redesigned user interface, for our review and feedback.

PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise

Prescription Drug Labeling Resources? and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling Final

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS
We have the following comments/recommendations that are not approvability issues:

1. The submitted data are insufficient to support the demonstration of efficacy for
scopolamine nasal gel for the prevention of nausea induced by motion. Although
statistically significant results were obtained on the evaluation of the key
secondary endpoint of subjects with no nausea and no use of rescue medication
in Trial MS-33, the results were not highly persuasive (p=0.03). Additionally, the
results of the analysis for this endpoint (i.e., subjects with no nausea and no use
of rescue medication) in Trial MS-29 were not nominally significant (p=0.12).
Provide additional clinical data to support the demonstration of safety and
effectiveness of scopolamine nasal gel for the “prevention of nausea” portion of
the proposed indication (i.e., the prevention of nausea induced by motion).

2. We refer to our information request of om , and the guidance for

COMPLETE RESPONSE

Corium, Inc.

Attention: a

Dear Dr. a:

Please refer to your New Drug Application (NDA) dated September 30, 2019, received
September 30, 2019, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for ADLARITY (donepezil transdermal
system). We also refer you to the Discipline Review Letter (DRL) dated May 5, 2020
and the clarifying communication sent May 29, 2020 (response to your request for a
clarifying teleconference).

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated April 28, 2020, April 29, 2020,
May 1, 2020, May 22, 2020, June 1, 2020, June 15, 2020, June 30, 2020, and July 8,
2020, which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections
of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies
cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
those issues.

The list below is inclusive of requests communicated in the Discipline Review letter
dated May 4, 2020, and additional issues identified after May 4, 2020. This list serves
as a comprehensive list of deficiencies and additional comments for this Complete
Response. If significant changes are made to the product (e.g., in formulation,
design, and size) to address the Complete Response deficiencies identified
below, additional studies such as in vivo adhesion studies, other clinical
assessments, and/or redevelopment of some quality test methods and
acceptance criteria may be necessitated.

Complete Response Deficiencies

1. ©® the TDS can be easily separated oy
and as such is a major product quality, use, and safety concern.
Figure 1 Cross-Sectional View of the Corplex Donepezil TDS (Not to Scale)

Layer 1: Overlay Backing/Adhesive

Layer 2: Separating Layer

Layer 3: Drug Matrix

Layer 4: Microporous Membrane

Layer 5: Contact Adhesive

Layer 6: Release Liner (Removed at the time of use)

Recommendation to Address Deficiencies:
To address this concern, you should a
to the extent that the product cannot be
peeled apart by hand (i.e., when peeled apart by hand, the membranes are

significantly damaged or destroyed when the attempt is made).

2. There is an overarching concern that the drug product on release is not equivalent to
the drug product after long-term storage. Multiple changes have been observed

during drug product storage under long term conditions: ow

It is also unclear whether the donepezil salt:base ratio changes during storage. In
addition to these differences, there is a significant drop in in vitro drug release
results. The 24-hour time point results decrease | % over 24 months. The 48-
hour time point results decrease |) % over 24 months. The 168-hour time point
results decrease | % over 24 months. The provided in vitro skin permeation
data and the limited in vivo pharmacokinetics data (of up to six-month-old drug
product) are not sufficient to demonstrate that the observed decrease in the in vitro
drug release rate from the proposed drug product would not affect its therapeutic
performance throughout the shelf-life of the proposed drug product.

We acknowledge the results provided from the in vitro skin permeation studies
comparing the to-be-marketed formulation to the same formulation without one of
the excipients (N-1). You conclude that all results are comparable to the control, thus
©® do not play a role in drug

delivery. However, there is very large variability in all of the results (e.g., control flux
is 3.1 + 2.5; control cumulative permeation is 505 + 408). With high variability, it is
unclear whether N-1 in vitro skin permeation studies in general are capable of
determining the impact of individual excipients on drug delivery.

Recommendation to Address Deficiencies:

To demonstrate the product at the beginning of shelf life is equivalent to product at
the end of shelf life, you should conduct a bioequivalence study on product near the
beginning of shelf life comparing it to product near the end of the proposed shelf-life.
Alternatively, you should develop a formulation which exhibits greater stability with
respect to excipient degradation, migration, ® etc. We also
refer you to Complete Response deficiency #3, which recommends a new
bioequivalence study with oral Aricept, and Complete Response deficiency #1,
which may result in a reformulation. As such, you may want to consider
incorporating product that is freshly manufactured (<6 months in age) and product
that is nearing the end of shelf-life (>12 months in age) in your trial if the
reformulated product is not expected to exhibit greater stability than the current
formulation.

3. We determined that the intended commercial process has major differences
compared to the process used for the pivotal clinical batch used in Study P 15086.
Specifically, there have been changes in

for the registration batches (Page 24
of the W38132 executed batch record in 3.2.R), but this is not evidenced for the
batch used in Study P-15086. These differences could have an impact on™

and
could result in the variation in delivery of the active ingredient to the patients.

Further, the in vitro bridging data in the submission is inadequate to justify the above
changes for the following reasons: (1) With respect to the in vitro release method, a
different method at batch release was used for the batch in Study P-15086 from that
for the registration batches; (2) The study and testing regarding donepezil base
content was not conducted at batch release for the registration batches, nor for the
batch used in Study P-15086; (3) The submitted document in P.2.3 Appendix 1,
Bioequivalence (BE) and Registration Product Comparison, compared batches with
different manufacturing processes, active product ingredient particle sizes, storage
times, and storage temperatures in addition to scale changes. With all these
variations, it is difficult to make a conclusive and holistic comparability assessment.

Recommendation to Address Deficiencies:

To address this concern, you should conduct a new bioequivalence (BE) study with
oral Aricept utilizing the proposed commercial product/manufacturing process.
Please note that should significant changes to the formulation or manufacturing

5. During a recent inspection of the a
manufacturing facility, our field investigator conveyed deficiencies to the
representative of the facility.

Recommendation to Address Deficiencies:
Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before this application may
be approved.

Additional Comments

The following comments are not approvability issues, but should be addressed in the
resubmission of this application.

1. Sections S.2.1 and P.3.1 and sections pertaining to combination product
manufacturing were not prepared in accordance with the guidance titled
“Identification of Manufacturing Establishments in Applications Submitted to
CBER and CDER: Questions and Answers.” You should provide updated
versions of these sections.

2. An incorrect FEI number was provided in the FDA Form 356h for |

. You should provide an updated copy of the FDA Form
356h.

3. The amendment to the NDA, submitted on April 28, 2020, included an unsolicited
facility submission. This facility was not assessed during this review cycle. The
assessment of this facility will be completed when the NDA is resubmitted.

4. Data was provided on March 31, 2020, to demonstrate that active product
ingredient (API) particle size did not impact o® The

data available up to 24 months for both drug product strengths. Tighten the
pouch seal strength limits based on all available release and stability data for the
primary registration batches.

this should be further clarified.

10. We note that you have committed to addressing the following questions, but
responses are currently pending:

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

NDA 212304
Page 6

a. Question 2 from our December 31, 2019, Information Request: Develop a
method for the separation strength of

). Monitor separation strength on
release and stability of the drug product. Set and justify the associated
acceptance criterion.

b. Question 6b from our December 31, 2019, Information Request: Provide a
comparison of the donepezil free base and donepezil HCI content in the
clinical drug product batches to the registration drug product batches.

c. Question 3 from our March 9, 2020, Information Request: Results from the
ICH Q1B photostability study indicates that the unpouched drug product is
impacted by exposure to light. Perform an in-use stability study to
demonstrate that the drug product quality remains unaffected through the
longest expected period of use (7 days) at lowest dose (5 mg/day). Ensure
that the drug product is exposed to light (e.g., 10 hours a day) each of the
seven days to mimic a worst-case scenario.

11. We are concerned with the proposed oral-to-transdermal system switch strategy
for the 5 mg/day treatment. For the 5 mg/day treatment, donepezil concentrations
during the first 10 days after oral-to-transdermal system switch were observed to
be lower than the oral Cmin,ss Of 20.6 ng/mL. The clinical relevance of these lower
concentrations is not known, and to ensure clinical benefit, oral supplementation
with 5 mg/day ARICEPT may be required during the first 2 weeks of oral-to-
transdermal system switch. Additional simulations must be conducted to derive
an appropriate oral-to-transdermal system switch for 5 mg/day treatment.

12. Due to the issue stated above related to ease of separation of the laminate
layers, we have serious safety concerns that could arise if layer separation
occurs during the use of the ADLARITY transdermal system. If layer separation
occurs while patients are wearing the ADLARITY transdermal system, alterations
in donepezil dosing may occur. If the patient or caregiver touches any exposed
layers that contain donepezil, unintended exposure to donepezil may occur. If
the active layer segments can be easily separated by hand, patients or
caregivers may elect to modify their dose (e.g., only applying 4 of the 9
segments), or may choose to apply the smaller segments to locations on the
body not previously studied (e.g., for aesthetic preference). Each of these clinical
situations represents an unacceptable safety risk.

13. Due to the issue stated above related to ease of separation of the laminate
layers, we indicated to you on January 31, 2020, that “labeling enhancements will
not address the inherent product design flaw and the risk of the separation of

the TDS > and that a labeling
comprehension study (LCS) is not the appropriate mechanism to address the
concerns. We note, however, that you conducted an LCS and we have reviewed

the contents of that April 10, 2020, submission. Our review determined that there
are significant methodology concerns with your LCS that raise concerns with
interpretation of the study results. The patient user group did not include a
representative sample size of 15 study participants, the simulation of transdermal
system application did not replicate real world use as patients and caregivers
applied the transdermal system to an easel rather than the application areas
described in the Instructions for Use, and based on your response to our
Information Request for product samples, the intent-to-market product was not
used in the LCS. Moreover, the errors observed in this study indicate the labeling
did not provide assurance that patients and caregivers could adequately identify
adhesive squares that remained on the skin or on the liner. Thus, we are unable
to conclude that the LCS confirms that the product labeling addresses the risks
associated with the separation of © the transdermal system
©® Therefore, we remain concerned that labeling

enhancements alone will not minimize the risk to patients and caregivers if™

PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

A. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise

adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR
Requirements for Prescribing Information’ and Pregnancy and Lactation Labeling
Final Rule? websites, including regulations and related guidance documents and
the Selected Requirements for Prescribing Information (SRPI) — a checklist of
important format items from labeling regulations and guidances.

If you revise labeling, use the SRPI checklist to ensure that the Prescribing
Information conforms with format items in regulations and guidances. Your
response must include updated content of labeling [21 CFR 314.50(1)(1)(i)] in
structured product labeling (SPL) format as described at FDA.gov.?

CARTON AND CONTAINER LABELING

A. You should submit draft carton and container labeling revised as follows:

General Comments (Overpack Professional Sample; Container [Pouch] Labels

and Carton Labeling; Trade and Professional Sample; 5 mg/hour and 10
mg/hour).

1. The NDC numbers are denoted by a placeholder. Therefore, we are
unable to assess the proposed NDC numbers from a medication
safety perspective. You should add the proposed NDC numbers to
the labels and labeling for our review and comment.

2. As currently presented on the labels and labeling, the product
strength is not consistently expressed and may lead to
misinterpretation. You should ensure the strength is expressed as
“xx mg/day’ wherever it appears on the labels and labeling to avoid
confusion.

3. The expiration date format is not defined on the container label and

carton labeling. To minimize confusion and reduce the risk for
deteriorated product medication errors, identify the format you
intend to use. The Agency recommends that the human-readable
expiration date on the product package label include a year, month,
and non-zero day. Additionally, the Agency recommends that the
expiration date appear in YYYY-MM-DD format if only numerical
characters are used or in YYYY-MMM-DD if alphabetical characters
are used to represent the month. If there are space limitations on
the product package, the human-readable text may include only a
year and month, to be expressed as: YYYY-MM if only numerical
characters are used or YYYY-MMM if alphabetical characters are
used to represent the month. A hyphen or a space may be used to
separate the portions of the expiration date.

4. The usual dosage statement is not present on the labels and
labeling. The usual dosage statement is required per 21 CFR
201.55. We recommend that you revise the container labels and
carton labeling to read: “Recommended dosage: See prescribing
information and Instructions for Use for dosing and application
instructions.”

5. We note the product has heat exposure limitations. Specifically, the
Prescribing Information (Section 2.4 and Section 17) states that long
exposure to external heat sources (e.g., excessive sunlight, saunas,
solariums or heating pads) should be avoided. However, the
container labels and carton labeling do not contain this warning. Add
a statement, such as “Avoid applying heat’ or a similar statement to
the principal display panel of the labels and labeling.

6. The storage statement on the container labels and carton labeling is
inconsistent with that presented in the Prescribing Information
labeling. For increased comprehension by lay users, we recommend
the storage statement be revised to read: “ Gy

(b) (4)

We note the presence of a placeholder for the lot number and
expiration date on the container labels and carton labeling.
However, it is unclear how the lot number and expiration date will
appear. Ensure that there are no other numbers located in close
proximity to the lot number where it can be mistaken as the lot
number and ensure the lot number is clearly differentiated from the
expiration date.>

The color scheme of the 10 mg/day strength statement () and
the proprietary name (ADLARITY) appear in the same |’ color

( ©) The use of the same! color font for the
proprietary name and one of the product's strengths minimizes the
difference between the two strengths, which may lead to wrong
strength selection errors. You should revise the font color of the
proprietary name or revise the color scheme of the 10 mg/day
strength, so that either the strength or the proprietary name appears
in its own unique color and the color does not overlap with any other
colors utilized in highlighting the strengths.

The storage statement lacks instruction to store the transdermal
system in the pouch until ready for use, which may lead to
inappropriate storage. We recommend adding the instruction to
“Keep ADLARITY in the individual sealed pouch until use” to the
storage statement on the labels and labeling.

You should add the following bolded statement or appropriate
alternative to the carton and container labels per 21 CFR 208.24(d):
""ATTENTION PHARMACIST: Each patient is required to receive
the enclosed Medication Guide.""

B. Container (Pouch) Labels (Trade and Professional Sample; 5 mg/day and 10

mg/day)
1.

The ‘Rx only” statement appears more prominent than other
important information on the Principal Display Panel (PDP). Per our
guidance, the proprietary name, established name, product strength,
route of administration, and warnings or cautionary statements
should be the most prominent information on the

PDP®. Ensure the “Rx only” statement does not compete in
prominence with the aforementioned critical information. Consider
decreasing the font size and relocating the “Rx only” statement to
the top or bottom of the PDP or address this concern by other
means.

2. The strength statement appears twice on the PDP, which is
unnecessary and clutters the label. You should streamline the
strength statement to appear once on the principal display panel as
“xx mg/day”.

3. The statement “For Transdermal Use Only’ is not prominent and
may be overlooked, which may pose risk of wrong route of
administration or wrong technique medication errors. You should
improve the prominence of the statement “For Transdermal Use
Only’ to emphasize proper use of this product and to ensure it i is | not
overlooked. To accomplish this, consider

or address this concern
by other means.

4. The net quantity statement (i.e., Contains 1 system) is located in
close proximity to the product strength. From postmarketing
experience, the risk of numerical confusion between the strength
and net quantity increases when the net quantity statement is
located in close proximity to the strength statement. You should
relocate the net quantity statement away from the product strength,
such as to the bottom of the principal display panel.

C. Carton Labeling (Trade and Professional Sample; 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day)

1. The transdermal system disposal instructions on the carton labeling
lack the important warning to dispose out of the reach of pets. We
are concerned that this may result in inappropriate disposal, which
could result in accidental exposure by pets. Revise the statement’ “

™® to read ‘ 4
wherever it appears in the disposal
instructions (for example, on the back panel under “
).

2. As presented, there is a “flap’ which appears in the lower right-hand
corner of the PDP. The intent of this “flap” is unclear (e.g., is this a
peel-off label to access additional product information or a graphic
design?). You should clarify the intent of this “flap.”

carton labeling to avoid misinterpretation of this information.
4. The statement “ > on the back panel of

the carton labeling is inconsistent with the statement in the
Prescribing Information. Additionally, postmarketing reports suggest
that negative statements may be misinterpreted as an affirmative
action if the word ‘®®” is overlooked. For consistency with the
Prescribing Information and to avoid misinterpretation, you should
revise the statement “ > to read “Keep in
the individually sealed pouch until use.”

D. Carton Labeling (Trade, 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day)

1. We note the presence of ©@ which
overlaps the product strength (“XX mg’) near the bottom of the
principal display panel. We are concerned that users may
misinterpret this!"" to mean that 4 systems are required for a XX
mg dose. To avoid confusion, you should remove this |)"" from
the principal display panel, or address this concern by other means.

2. As currently presented, there is no placeholder for a product
identifier on the carton labeling. In September 2018, the Agency
released draft guidance on product identifiers required under the
Drug Supply Chain Security Act.’ The Act requires manufacturers
and re-packagers to affix or imprint a product identifier to each
package and homogenous case of a product intended to be
introduced in a transaction in(to) commerce beginning November
27, 2017, and November 27, 2018, respectively. We recommend
that you review that draft guidance which is available at the following
link:
https://www.fda.gov/media/116304/download
If you determine that the product identifier requirements apply to
your product's labeling, we request you add a placeholder for the

human-readable and machine-readable (2-D data matrix barcode)
product identifier to the carton labeling.

3. It is unclear whether pouches are intended for individual dispensing.
The carton labeling contains important safety information that may
not be available to users if pouches are dispensed individually. You
should clarify whether pouches are intended for individual
dispensing or whether they should be dispensed in the sealed

carton. If the latter, you should consider revising the carton labeling
to state “Dispense in this sealed carton’ on the principal display
panel, or address this concern by other means.

E. Carton Labeling (Overpack, Professional Sample, 5 mg/day and 10 mg/day)

1. The readability of the net quantity statement can be improved.
Consider revising the net quantity statement to read “Contains| (j
sample packs. Each sample pack contains one © system.”

F. Instructions for Use (IFU)

1. As currently presented in Step 1 (“
”), the illustration identifying possible
locations for the patch may be misinterpreted to mean that a patch
should be applied to more than one site and could result in an
overdose. We recommend you consider the labeling of other
transdermal systems (e.g., that for rivastigmine) as you determine
how best to depict acceptable sites for patch application.

Attention: | David Zuchero, MS, JD
US Agent for AFT Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.

Dear Mr. Zuchero:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received August 31, 2021,
and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act for Combogesic (acetaminophen/ibuprofen) solution for
injection.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated June 20, 2022, and received
June 21, 2022, which was not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable
sections of the amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the
deficiencies cited in this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
hat we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
hese issues.

NONCLINICAL

You have not provided adequate toxicological risk assessments for leachables over the
5 mcg/day qualification threshold. We acknowledge your original approach in utilizing a
‘oxicological threshold of concern of 120 mcg/day as recommended in ICH M7.
However, this approach only addresses the genotoxicity aspects of a compound and is
not acceptable to address the general toxicity of any given leachable compound. In
addition, we acknowledge receipt of the June 21, 2022 submission containing a
oxicological risk assessment for tentatively identified compounds detected above the
analytical evaluation threshold; however, this submission was not formally reviewed
because, as noted in your cover letter of the submission, the compounds have only
been tentatively identified to date and method validation is still ongoing. Our
assessment of the safety of leachables to support a marketing application should be
based on confirmed compounds quantified using validated methods.

Reference ID: 5007085

NDA 215320
Page 2

Information needed to address the deficiency

Submit a revised toxicological risk assessment for all leachable compounds detected
above the 5 mcg/day threshold. Submit documentation that the structural identification
of the compounds has been confirmed and quantification has been completed using
validated methods. The risk assessment should be based on the maximum level of
each leachable expected to be present in the drug product based upon the analysis of
the data from your long-term stability samples. The approach for toxicological evaluation
of the safety of leachables should be based on good scientific principles. Include copies
of all referenced studies upon which a safety assessment is based. In addition, consider
the following points as you prepare your toxicological risk assessments:

a. If you employ a Permissible Daily Exposure (PDE) assessment as described in
ICH Q3C, provide justification for all safety factors employed.

b. Published literature submitted to support the safety of any compound rarely
provides adequate detail of the study design and study results to permit a
thorough independent evaluation of the data. Summary reviews, [e.g., BIBRA
Toxicology Advice & Consulting (BIBRA), Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR),
Human and Environmental Risk Assessment on ingredients of household
cleaning products (HERA)], although potentially useful to identify original source
material, are not acceptable as the source material is not provided and the
conclusions cannot be independently verified. Submission of any published study
reports should be accompanied by a detailed comparison to modern toxicology
study endpoints and any shortcomings of the study should be discussed and
justification should be provided to support your assertion that these data are
adequate to support the safety of your container closure system.

c. Safety justifications based on analogous compounds are also not acceptable
unless you can provide adequate data to support your conclusions that a risk
assessment based on one compound can be logically interpolated to represent
an adequate safety evaluation for your leachable/extractable. This should include
a detailed understanding of the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and
elimination of the compounds and an adequate scientific bridge to interpolate a
NOAEL for the extractable/leachable compound.

version of your device should be clearly stated and the relevance of said testing
should be justified. Please note that due to the device changes, additional
deficiencies may be identified once the final device design is submitted.

Ora
You reference Master Access File (MAF) oe for significant documentation to
support the device constituent of your combination product. There are outstanding
deficiencies, which have been separately communicated to the MAF Holder. We
recommend: a) you work with MAF Holder to ensure adequate resolution of the
identified deficiencies, and b) resubmit your NDA only once the deficiencies are all
resolved and adequate documentation is present in the MAF.

Human Factors
11.We note that you conducted a validation of adhesive effectiveness and local skin
tolerability of the medical adhesive used to attach the on-body infusor to the
patient, and that the study protocol lists the following exclusion criteria for the study
participants [Clinical Protocol No. scP-00-003 - Appendix 16.1.1 Protocol and
Protocol Amendments.pdf Section 4.2, page 24]:

4.2. Exclusion Criteria -
A Subject is not eligible for inclusion if any of the following criteria apply:

1. History of chronic skin conditions requiring medical therapy.

2. History of allergy to medical adhesives.

3. Received oral antihistamines (Benadryl, Allegra, Zyrtec, etc.) or
systemic steroids (e.g. prednisone, dexamethasone, etc.) in past
7-days.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

Silver Spring, MD 20993

4. Used body lotions, oils or ointments on abdomen (adhesion area)
within past 24 hours.

5. History of major abdominal surgery affecting the site of device
placement.

6. Any local abdominal skin condition on the day of treatment i.e.
sunburn, rash, eczema, etc.

7. Any surgical or medical condition which in the opinion of the
Investigator may interfere with participation in the study or which
may affect the outcome of the study.

However, we note that your human factors/usability use-related risk analysis does
not assess the risk of a patient applying the infusor if they have the characteristics
listed in items 1 through 6 above. We further note that information about these
characteristics does not appear in the proposed Instructions for Use (IFU) of your
proposed subject device beyond the statement in Step 4: “Do not select a site
where the skin is irritated or broken.” This is important because a patient with these
characteristics could experience skin injuries from the medical adhesive or that the
device could fail to adhere to the skin over the time of treatment. Please submit an
updated use-related risk analysis that assesses the risk to the patient of using the
device if the patient has these characteristics. If you determine that the related
tasks are critical tasks, please update the instructions for use with your proposed
tisk mitigations (e.g., contraindication statements, warnings), and submit
supplemental human factors validation study data to demonstrate that the device
can be used safely and effectively by the intended users for the intended use, or
provide a justification for not conducting a supplemental human factors study. In
addition, please add the appropriate contraindications to OM the
Prescribing Information (Pl) or provide a justification addressing why this
information does not need to be provided to the intended prescribers of your
proposed subject device.

12.We acknowledge your human factors (HF) study report included with your June
30, 2020, Class 2 resubmission. However, your Device Improvement Report
submitted on September 29, 2020 indicates that your proposed device was
modified subsequent to the HF study. We expect the HF validation study to be
conducted with your to-be-marketed device. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the
device modifications affect critical tasks associated with the safe and effective use
of the device or require changes to your Instructions for Use (IFU). Thus, additional
information is necessary to determine whether the modified device can be used
safely and effectively.

We recommend you update your comprehensive use-related risk analysis taking
into consideration the device modifications. The comprehensive use-related risk
analysis should include a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of all the steps
involved in using your product (e.g., based on a task analysis) the errors that users
might commit or the tasks they might fail to perform and the potential negative
clinical consequences of use errors and task failures.

Software/Cybersecurity
13.We could not locate information regarding your alarms/errors in your Master File.

Based on the aforementioned information and data, you should determine whether
you need to submit the results of another human factors (HF) validation study
conducted under simulated use conditions with representative users performing
necessary tasks to demonstrate safe and effective use of the product. If you
determine that another HF validation study does not need to be submitted for your
product, submit your risk analysis, comparative analyses, and justification for not
submitting another HF validation study to the Agency for review when you respond
‘0 the application deficiencies. The Agency will notify you if we concur with your
determination.

The comparative analyses should include a labeling comparison, a comparative
‘ask analysis, and a physical comparison between the user interface that was
validated in your HF validation study and your modified user interface for the
purposes of identifying what differences exist between the user interfaces.

If you determine that you do need to submit a HF validation study for your product,
he risk analysis can be used to inform the design of a human factors validation
study protocol for your product. We recommend you submit your study protocol for
eedback from the Agency before commencing your study. Please note we will
need 60 days to review and provide comments on the HF validation study protocol.
Plan your development program timeline accordingly. Note that submission of a
protocol for review is not a requirement. If you decide not to submit a protocol, this
approach carries some risk to you because prospective Agency review is not
possible, but this is a decision for your company.

The specific requests are communicated to the Master File Holder. As your device
is a software medical controlled device, there remain items which you need to
identify in your Safety Assurance Case to demonstrate you have adequately
defined and verified your software. Please work with the Master file holder and
update your Safety Assurance Case to contain the specific information the Master
File is instructed to provide to you. This includes:

a. Reliability specifications for your system level alarms/errors.

Safety Assurance Case: Introduction

(b) (4)

Your device is an on-body infusion pump. There are several user-created routes
of fluid and particulate ingress (e.g., washing hands following going to the
bathroom). There are credible avenues for fluid and particulate ingress allowed
because of your use-case. Furthermore, you have requirements for certain parts
of your device to be protected from fluid/particulate ingress in order for the device
to function safely and effectively. Provide ingress testing and labeling
commensurate with your use-case.

® Please redesign your device to include error notification in a timely
fashion so that a user does not unknowingly experience an underdose event for a
significant period of time or provide scientifically (i.e., clinically) valid rationale for
the selected © error notification time.

In SNO040 you declare a modification has been made to the device (See Deficiency
#1). You have not updated your Safety Assurance Case (SAC) based on the
modifications discussed. Therefore, your provided SAC contained in SN0034 device-
ra0048 is considered irrelevant. A complete SAC is needed to demonstrate the device is
safe for its intended use through (1) adequate verification and validation of design
requirements, (2) adequate risk mitigations and (3) demonstration of adequate
reliability. Therefore, provide a SAC containing all the elements described in the Agency
Guidance Document “Infusion Pumps Total Product Life Cycle”
(https://www.fda.gov/media/78369/download) for your to-be-marketed device and

address the following high level structural deficiencies as well as those associated with
each of the three sections of the safety assurance case:

you should include the sequence and/or revision of the file with the file number as
it is listed in your submission. Please provide complete reference information for
your cited evidence in your SAC. We recommend you work with the MAF holder
to gain all applicable reference document pointer information prior to submitting
your updated SAC.
18. (b) (4)
o@ It remains unclear how you link your performed testing back
to the hazards in your system. Your SAC does not trace clearly from your system-
level requirements to the performed testing to mitigate hazards, and the specific
hazard present. While we note you provide DD-0094 for Design Inputs/Outputs
and Hazard and Risk Analyses in RA-0043 and RA-0047, it remains unclear how
you trace between your requirements and your hazards to ensure that your testing
as mitigated your identified hazards. Please provide a Design Verification and
Validation Plan that details your sampling plan, sampling justifications, aging
approach, and verification output methods (i.e., specific reports) which traces
between the hazards present in your system and your performed testing of your
to-be-marketed device.

your device type. Alternatively, you can independently demonstrate the
acceptability of the methods for evaluating design requirements.

d. You discuss your device’s design control process in 3.2.R.1.P.3.1. You do
not mention the word ‘regulatory’ in this document. You should complete
your device development activities prior to seeking regulatory approval.
Specifically, you should receive regulatory approval before completion of

®® and commercialization of your product. We remind you that it
is our expectation that you submit your to-be-marketed device for regulatory
review and we note you have continued to make changes to your device
(Deficiency #1). Therefore, we believe your approach to device design
control is inadequate. Revise your approach to design controls to ensure
your design is ‘frozen’ before seeking initial regulatory approval. Only
submit your device for regulatory review once you have determined the
design which you intend to market.

21.You provide device-ddp0038 as your Verification and Validation Plan. However,
this document is inadequate for several reasons which are detailed. Without an
adequate and complete Verification and Validation Plan, we are uncertain of the
relevance of the documentation you present to demonstrate your design
requirements have been adequately verified and validated. In order of us to ensure
your device is safe and effective, please revise your device design verification and

validation plan and evidence to address the following:
a. You point to files within MAF oor significant evidence of your

verification and validation activities. We note the Master File documentation

refers to different risk and sampling documentation than your submission.

We do not know which documentation drives your design, including your

requirements, system risks, and sample sizing. Please work with the Master
File holder and present unified documentation which contains all the
necessary information to understand your design intent and testing design
approach.

Your Verification and Validation Plan lacks significant detail expected in this
document. Please revise your plan or provide specific pointers to the
location of the following documentation locations within your Verification
and Validation Plan:
i. Sampling Plan
ii. Statistical Methods/Approaches
iii. Aging Plan
iv. Description of the samples used for testing. We note you have
changed your device during the review cycle (Deficiency #1). We
specifically request that you state for EACH report if the to-be-
marketed device is used as test samples. If the samples differ from
the to-be-marketed device in ANY manner (form, fit, function, etc.),
you should explain this clearly and justify why the modification to the

samples does not impact the results of the testing

We note there are reports in MA which you do not refer to and cont in,
the information you need. For example, the information in MAF
© does not verify your device © shelf life
© ""You refer to MAF Les
© but there is no Report ‘x.’ Please work with the
Master File Holder and refer to the correct documentation evidence in your
SAC to support your argument.

We are unable to locate evidence which you refer to in device-ddp0038
(Verification and Validation Plan). For example, we are unable to locate
Report-0332: This document is not referred to in your Reviewer Guide. We
are unable to review evidence if we cannot locate the referenced
information. Please ensure all necessary evidence is contained in your
submission.

The evidence you are using to support the safety and efficacy of your device
is known to have changed (Deficiency #1). For example, scP-00-004 in
SN0040 is not referenced by device-rpt-0360. Provide a revised Verification
and Validation Summary and SAC which references the current applicable
documentation, including report revision, so we are certain of the evidence
you are using to demonstrate your device is safe and effective.

You state several requirements do not require validation. We disagree this
this assessment. You need to demonstrate that your device performs as
designed (i.e., verification) and the design is adequate for your intended use
(i.e., validation). Design Validation is part of 21 CFR 820.30 which is

explanation of adequacy for the following requirements: oe

g. You do not provide evidence for all the expected Essential Performance
Requirements for an Infusion Pump, such as Flow Rate Accuracy. Without
defining, verifying, and validating the requirements for your device, we are
uncertain how you have determined your device is adequate for your
intended use. Please identify all essential performance requirements and
provide corresponding evidence to support the verification and validation
for each requirement.

h. The data you provide to demonstrate your requirements are met are
inadequate. These data are principally contained in the referenced MAF
Please work with the Master File Holder to resolve the deficiencies in

the Master File documentation.

22.In summary, to support the adequate verification of your design requirements, you
should provide evidence in the form of test reports which contain clear objectives
and quantitative scientific evidence that your design functions to its specification.
The test reports you cited lacked all the elements described in the FDA Guidance
Document “Recommended Content and Format of Non-Clinical Bench
Performance Testing Information in Premarket Submissions”
(https://www.fda.gov/media/113230/download) from December 2019. Therefore,
please provide test reports which contain clearly defined, objectives, acceptance
criteria (including sample sizing based on the associated risks with statistically
valid rationale), verifiable objective evidence, analysis, and conclusions so that we
can determine whether the evidence supports the device meets the specifications.
Please be aware it remains our expectation that you demonstrate your device
functions at its labeled boundary conditions. Please provide design verification
which evaluates all design requirements at the appropriate boundary conditions of
use and demonstrate that your requirements are adequate for your intended use.

Attention: Arman Nolledo
Manager, Regulatory Affairs

Dear Mr Nolledo:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated and received May 13, 2014, and
your amendments pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act for Acetaminophen Injection, 10 mg/mL.

We acknowledge receipt of your amendment dated June 30, 2020, which constituted a
complete response to our November 9, 2018, action letter.

We also acknowledge receipt of your amendments dated December 7, and 16, 2020,
which were not reviewed for this action. You may incorporate applicable sections of the
amendment by specific reference as part of your response to the deficiencies cited in
this letter.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

NONCLINICAL

1. You have not provided adequate validated leachable data to permit a substantive
toxicological risk assessment for the proposed container closure system.

Information needed to resolve deficiency

Submit a revised toxicological risk assessment based on validated leachable
data that characterizes the trends in leachables over the course of the proposed
shelf-life. Include later timepoints in your proposed shelf-life to fully inform the
trends in leachables, particularly given the observations of novel adducts forming
in the drug product solution. The risk assessment should be based on the
projected highest level of any leachable over stability. Submit a risk assessment
for any compound present over 5 mcg/day taking into consideration the
maximum daily dose of your drug product.

Reference ID: 4721759

NDA 206968
Page 2

2. You have not provided an adequate toxicological risk assessment for the

acetaminophen adducts detected as leachables in the drug product. Although
your risk assessment is based on in silico and read-across evaluations of the

larger fragments of the molecule, there are no data to suggest that this read-

across reliably predicts the toxicological potential of the adduct as a whole.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
To address this deficiency, either conduct an intravenous toxicology study with
the four adducts or provide data to support the conclusion that these adducts are
not stable and rapidly convert back to acetaminophen and the presumed

©® degradants from which they are formed.

PRODUCT QUALITY

3. Your PDE-based approach to selecting targeted leachables is concerning

because not all leachables above the 5 mcg/day threshold may be observed.

Information needed to resolve deficiency

In order to obtain a complete leachables profile for your leachables studies,
demonstrate that your validated leachables methods can detect all the
extractables above the Analytical Evaluation Threshold (AET) based on an SCT
of {mcg /day with LODs/LOQs with acceptable S/N.

Per your response dated October 23, 2020, your validated method will adopt an
AET of [i mcg /L based on an SCT of |f}mcg/day and a Maximum daily volume
(MDV) of ® L/day without considering a 50% uncertainty factor.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
Include a 50% uncertainty factor to the final AET to accommodate variations in
response of the compounds with different response factors.

In your response dated November 20, 2020, we note that the newly submitted 9-
month leachable data were analyzed by the original semi-quantitative methods.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
Reanalyze the 9-month and subsequent stability time points, using the fully
validated methods that you are developing.

The non-volatile leachables at the 9-month point are significantly different from
those of the 3-month. Some of 3-month leachables disappeared and some new
ones appeared in the 9-month time point.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Silver Spring, MD 20993
www.fda.gov

Reference ID: 4721759

NDA 206968

Information needed to resolve deficiency

This can be indicative of either an issue with the analytical method used or the
appearance of secondary leachables. Provide a full leachable profile with data
collected on a fresh batch of drug product, at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12-month time points
using well-validated methods.

Module P.8.3. states that 6 month accelerated studies under 40° + 2°C/ NMT
25% RH were provided for 2019 batch stability samples 1907059, 1907060, and
1907061. However, we cannot locate this information.

Information needed to resolve deficiency
Provide the complete data for at least three batches of drug product stored under
accelerated conditions.

Table 2 in the Photostability study report ARL/STDR/0066/19 was not included in
the report.

Information needed to resolve the deficiency
Provide this information in your resubmission.

PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

9. We reserve comment on the proposed labeling until the application is otherwise

adequate. We encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR

Baxter Healthcare Corporation
Attention: Hiren Gadhiya, RAC
Manager, Global Regulatory Affairs
1 Baxter Parkway

Deerfield, IL 60015

Dear Mr. Gadhiya:

Please refer to your new drug application (NDA) dated June 30, 2020, received June
30, 2020, and your amendments, submitted pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for DAPZURA RT (daptomycin) for Injection.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

NON-CLINICAL

You have not adequately qualified the safety (i.e., general toxicity) of several of the
leachables detected with your drug product.

The following are specific deficiencies and recommendations to address our concerns
regarding several leachables detected with your drug product:

In your submission dated March 31, 2021, in response to an information request,
you have not provided adequate safety information to support the qualification of
the following leachables:

Reference ID: 49288062

NDA 213645
Page 2

©) (8
Therefore, O® we

have insufficient data to conduct an independent safety review of these 5 leachable
compounds identified in your leachables assessment (Study Report BXU562758).

Information needed to resolve the deficiency

e Inthe absence of adequate information in the published literature or public

oxicological databases to support the safety of the identified leachables at the

levels detected in your drug product, additional nonclinical qualification studies
including repeated-dose toxicology studies are recommended for any leachable
hat exceeds the qualification threshold of 5 mcg/day. For example, you may
consider conducting a toxicology study in one relevant animal species of 28-day

duration using the API enriched with the identified leachables, administered in a

clinically relevant manner at leachable levels equivalent or greater than what

patients would be administered. Plan to include a justification for the species
selected for this nonclinical study.

e If an additional nonclinical study is planned, we recommend that you submit a

draft study protocol for the Agency to review prior to initiating any additional

nonclinical studies. By providing a draft protocol for comment, the Agency will be
better able to work with you on designing a study that can best inform the safety
of the identified leachables when administered at clinically relevant exposures.

e A justification indicating that the leachables in the drug product to be
administered to the animals is qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the
identified leachables described in Study Report BXU562758.

e Plan to conduct additional (Q)SAR evaluation(s) for bacterial mutagenicity for any
new leachables detected in any follow-up leachables testing that exceeds the 20
mcg/day qualification threshold. A follow-up Ames test (bacterial reverse
mutation assay) is recommended to qualify leachables with any identified
structural alerts for genotoxic potential.

PRESCRIBING INFORMATION

Your proposed Prescribing Information (PI) must conform to the content and format
regulations found at 21 CFR 201.56(a) and (d) and 201.57. As you develop your
proposed PI, we encourage you to review the labeling review resources on the PLR

c/o Akesobio, Inc.

Attention: Liang Liu (U.S. Agent)
81 Belhaven Avenue

Daly City, CA 94015

Dear Liang Liu:

Please refer to your biologics license application (BLA) dated July 15, 2021, received
July 16, 2021, and your amendments, submitted under section 351 (a) of the Public
Health Service Act for AK105.

We acknowledge receipt of your major amendment dated June 14, 2022, which
extended the goal date by three months.

We also refer to the general advice letter, issued October 14, 2022, notifying you that
the extended PDUFA date of October 16, 2022, would be missed due to travel
restrictions preventing the inspection of Akeso Biopharma Co., Ltd.

We have completed our review of this application, as amended, and have determined
that we cannot approve this application in its present form. We have described our
reasons for this action below and, where possible, our recommendations to address
these issues.

CLINICAL

1. Given the changing treatment landscape for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC),
current results of Study AK105-202 in patients with metastatic non-keratinizing
NPC with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at
least one other prior line of therapy treated with penpulimab-kcqx do not provide
a meaningful advantage over currently available therapy, as required by Section
21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 601.41 Subpart E for accelerated
approval.

Potential path forward for clinical deficiencies

2. You should conduct a multiregional randomized clinical trial comparing
penpulimab-kcqx to an acceptable control in patients with metastatic NPC which
should utilize progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
endpoints. The trial should enroll an adequate representation of U.S. patients,

Reference ID: 5313602

with demographics that reflect the more ethnically diverse population of patients
with NPC and should include adolescent patients.

PRODUCT QUALITY

Per 21 CFR 601.20 (c) “No product shall be licensed if any part of the process of or
relating to the manufacture of such product...would impair the assurances of continued
safety, purity, and potency...”.

3. Reference is made to information and data provided during the pre-license
inspection (PLI) at Akeso BioPharma Co., Ltd. (FEI 3017057933; Zhongshan,
China), and in response to the Agency’s information requests (IRs) dated
