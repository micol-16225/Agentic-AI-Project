We also reviewed your social media site on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0nofWh_uGU&t=12s, which is listed on your website.

Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel and Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drops drug products are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 331(d).

Unapproved New Drug and Misbranded Drug Violations

Based on the above labeling evidence, your Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel and Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drops are intended for use as ophthalmic demulcent (lubricant) drug products. As described below, these drug products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).

A drug product is a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), if it is not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for any of the product identified above.

Under section 505G of the FD&C Act, certain nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application —commonly referred to as “over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drugs”— may be legally marketed if they meet applicable requirements. With respect to nonprescription ophthalmic drug products, such as your Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel and Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drops, in order to be GRASE and not new drugs, these products must, among other things, conform to the conditions in the applicable OTC monograph, here OTC monograph M018: Ophthalmic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (hereinafter M018).1However, your Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel and Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drops drug products do not conform to the conditions specified in M018 for the reasons described below, and thus cannot be legally marketed under section 505G.

Specifically, your Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel and Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drops products are formulated with honey (fromLeptospermumspp.). Although you identify honey as an inactive ingredient on the product label, statements on your website show that honey is presented as an active ingredient, because it is intended to furnish pharmacological activity for the treatment of a disease or condition.2However, honey is not an active ingredient permitted for OTC monograph ophthalmic demulcent drug products under M018.12. Examples of you labeling statements presenting honey as an active ingredient include, “Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel contains a standardised medical grade Manuka honey developed fromLeptospermumspp. and is preservative free for moderate to severe dry eye,” “The application of medical gradeLeptospermumspp honey (Manuka) was associated with significant clinical improvements in dry eye and meibomian gland dysfunction,” and “We are experts in the therapeutic use of honey in products to help relieve some of the symptoms associated with chronic disease.” Additionally, a YouTube video created on June 18, 2020 and posted on your website includes statements by Melcare’s President, Anthony Maloney, describing the medical benefits of honey. For example, Mr. Maloney states, “We developed a range of products that use and leverage off the therapeutic efficacy of honey that is in wound care, eye care, skin care, and throat care.” Thus, honey is used in your product as an active ingredient and, because it is not an active ingredient permitted under M018.12, your Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel and Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drops products do not conform with the conditions for lawful marketing of an OTC ophthalmic demulcent or vasoconstrictor drug product as set forth in M018.

Therefore, your Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel and Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drops drug products do not comply with the applicable conditions specified in M018. In addition, these products have not otherwise been found GRASE.3Accordingly, these products are new drugs within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), and there is no basis under section 505G of the FD&C Act under which these products would be legally marketed without an approved application. Because there are no approved applications in effect for these products, these products are unapproved new drugs.

The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these unapproved new drug products violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).

Additionally, your Optimel Manuka+ Forte Eye Gel and Optimel Manuka+ Dry Eye Drops are misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), because these products are nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, but do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section and are not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355.

The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
