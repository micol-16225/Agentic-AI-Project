Unapproved New Drug and Misbranded Drug Violations

Your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops is a “drug” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.

Examples of claims from the product labeling and your website that provide evidence of the intended use (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of this product as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:

Based on the above evidence of intended use, your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops product is intended for use as an ophthalmic demulcent (lubricant) drug product. As described below, this drug product is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).

A drug product is a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), if it is not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). No FDA-approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, are in effect for your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops drug product.

Your drug product is marketed as an ophthalmic demulcent drug product and is subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, which generally governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Under section 505G of the FD&C Act, certain nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application —commonly referred to as “over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drugs”—may be legally marketed if they meet applicable requirements. With respect to nonprescription ophthalmic drug products, such as your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops, in order to be GRASE and not a new drug, the product must, among other things, conform to the conditions in the applicable OTC monograph, here Over-the-Counter (OTC) monograph M018: Ophthalmic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (hereinafter M018).1However, your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops drug product does not conform to the conditions specified in M018 for the reasons described below.

Your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops is a demulcent product formulated with several active ingredients that are not permitted for OTC monograph ophthalmic demulcent drug products. Specifically, according to your products labeling, your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops is formulated with the active ingredients hyaluronic acid and trehalose.

However, hyaluronic acid and trehalose are not active ingredients permitted for ophthalmic demulcent drug products under M018. 21. We note that, although you identify these ingredients as inactive ingredients on the product label, statements on your website show that they are active ingredients because they are intended to furnish pharmacological activity for the treatment of a disease or condition2. Example of these statements include, “made with hydrating polymers, sodium hyaluronate, and trehalose, iVIZIA’s unique multi-moisturizing formula improves eye comfort during computer work . . .” Furthermore, claims such as “can hold 1000x its weight in moisture” and “nature’s moisturizer,” are associated with the ingredient hyaluronic acid and claims such as “can survive extreme dehydration thanks to trehalose,” and “works with hyaluronic acid to resist drying longer” are associated with the ingredient trehalose. Thus, these ingredients are active ingredients and, because they are not active ingredients permitted under M018.12, your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops product does not conform with the conditions for lawful marketing of an OTC ophthalmic demulcent drug product as set forth in M018.

Thus, your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops product does not comply with the applicable conditions specified in M018 and has not otherwise been found GRASE.3Accordingly, this product is a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), and there is no basis under section 505G of the FD&C Act under which this product would be legally marketed without an approved application. Because there is no approved application in effect for this product, this product is an unapproved new drug. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this unapproved new drug product violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).

Additionally, your IVIZIA sterile lubricant eye drops is misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), because this product is a nonprescription drug subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, but does not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section and is not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355.

The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
